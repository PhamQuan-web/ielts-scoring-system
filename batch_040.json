I think one of the main drivers I think for people is money. And when you do anything solely because of money, then it will never work. And the reason people fail, I think the biggest reason is because they have failed to align their identity with their work. Because we spend a third of our lives, you know, in work. So a very big proportion of it, you know, needs to feel fulfilled. And it can only be fulfilled if you are, you understand, you know, what you like authentically inside, you know, and then, you know, go into a career.
