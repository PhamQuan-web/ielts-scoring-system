Now, for some of you that is really surprising because in your country maybe your examiner is quite serious. Maybe they do not have any emotions on their face. It really depends on the examiner and it depends on the day. So if you have a friendly examiner like Maddie, that is normal. Also, if you have a serious examiner, do not be put off. Just keep talking as though you are talking to a friend. So, in this case we have Maddie. She is really friendly. She smiles and she nods along, which is really helpful. it is more like a real conversation. I really wish all examiners did that. My first name is Alicia. Thanks Alicia.

In one of our previous videos, which you can see, that's Saskia and lots of you were giving feedback on our YouTube channel that the examiner was really friendly. Friendly. Now, for some of you that's really surprising because in your country maybe your examiner is quite serious. Maybe they don't have any emotions on their face. It really depends on the examiner and it depends on the day. So if you have a friendly examiner like Maddie, that's normal. Also, if you have a serious examiner, don't be put off. Just keep talking as though you're talking to a friend. So, in this case we have Maddie. She's really friendly. She smiles and she nods along, which is really helpful. It's more like a real conversation. I really wish all examiners did that. My first name is Alicia. Thanks Alicia.
