      "transcript_cleaned": "there are many reasons why water sports will become more popular in the future. Firstly, I would think that awareness because the awareness is increasing. People know that how to do the water sports or they are taking classes and they can get the guidance of instructors or some guide and so they they are fully aware then definitely in future this will be elevating and secondly he could use that improvement in the technology and safety gears. So because there is more and more technology behind playing water sports or any other sport. So because of technology people find it is safe. Thirdly the young generation they are highly influenced by the social media. So social media influence is there and because of that people are taking more interest as as soon as they watch any video be it is on Instagram or Facebook or somewhere else then they try to do they try to do those activities. And fourth last but not least you could use here adventure in nature. Today's youngsters they are more creative and they are more adventurous in nature and they love to do something different something more adventurous.
