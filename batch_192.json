So definitely it is how the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren has changed overtime. Yes it has been changed a lot. In fact, I would say a dramatic change I have noticed from that life and this life. In the past people used to live in joint households and that at that time and age as a result grand parents and grand children had close bonding but now a days due to urbanization and busy lifestyle people have started living separately in urban areas so there is now a weak connection between the grandparents and the grand children however still video calling is happening these are helping children and family members to stay connected with their elders. Should grandparents be involved in making decisions for their grandchildren in my point of view and in my opinion to a certain extent but not a lot. They can help in decision making like some for health and for discipline and some other easy go matters because there is a big generation gap between grand children and the grand parents. I think parents can play a vital role in making decisions. Because parents are more close to their children and they are adaptable to technology and the new things.
