So while driving, she was giving me directions. But at one point, I did not feel like it was enough. So I kind of took the phone from her and in I in my way took it on my hand and was turning the map around east and west, swiping up and down trying to understand where it was. And that is when she jokingly said to me like you always spin the map around and look like in olden times when people had maps in their hand they used to hold it northwest and spin it around and look and I started laughing as well because it is kind of true and that moment that joke kind of made me realize it is very true how technology has changed my life. If I did not have Google maps with me I would be re actually holding a real life map in front of me and I would be actually spinning it around as I was driving. I do not have to do that now. I drive and the map kind of sometimes even tells me 400 meters to the right, turn left, go to this intersection, keep on straight. I do not have to look at the map all the time. It tells me and I like I can spin it much easier as well. it is not a huge piece of paper I have to spin. it is just a small screen that I can turn around with my fingers. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much.",
