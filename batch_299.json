I I do not know if she is planning to take another IELTS test soon. I know she is done some IELTS tests in the past. I would say, you know, on the one hand, I would say forget about the nine. You do not need the nine. You do not need to prove anything to anyone. you you have mastered the English language. does not make any difference whether you get a nine or not. But I know if I was in her position as also an an uber competitive person, if I knew I could get the nine, I would want that nine. And so I can understand if the candidate wants to wants to go down that road of getting the nine. Examiners generally if they can avoid giving a nine, they prefer to give 8.5s. but yeah, an amazing performance. Very very well done. 8.5. The candidate is at C2 level for me.

I should have said this, I shouldn't have done that, I should have done this. It's a test. we and it always happens unfortunately. Um so yeah, in terms of language ability, the candidate certainly can get a nine. It's just a question of whether she can hold it together on test day. I I don't know if she's planning to take another IELTS test soon. I know she's done some IELTS tests in the past. Um I would say, you know, on the one hand, I would say forget about the nine. You don't need the nine. You don't need to prove anything to anyone. Um you you've mastered the English language. doesn't make any difference whether you get a nine or not. But I know if I was in her position as also an an uber competitive person, if I knew I could get the nine, I would want that nine. And so I can understand if the candidate wants to um wants to go down that road of getting the nine. Examiners generally if they can avoid giving a nine, they prefer to give 8.5s. Um but yeah, an amazing performance. Very very well done. 8.5. The candidate is at C2 level for me. But you let me know what you think.",
