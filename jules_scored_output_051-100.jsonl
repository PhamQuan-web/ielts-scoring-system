And it is, I think it is faster and, and it is nothing, I think it is, I think it is better than actual, like, you actually going to the store because you can see many brands and, you know, at the same time. So I think it is really time-saving. Yeah, I think. So what happened here is something that happens actually pretty regularly in the IELTS test. And it makes it look like the examiner is not listening. Because David had to ask a question that Maren had already answered. But the thing is, the examiner has a set list of questions. they are not inventing them as they ask them. they are taking them from a special booklet produced by Cambridge. So whether the information has already been given or not, the examiner is still going to ask the next question. So if you think that is a little bit weird, well, it is. But you still just have to answer and say something like, well, as I said, and as Maren did, try to add some extra information to this answer.",

They, they prefer talking to their online friends rather than talking to actual friends or families. So, yeah, I think as people started to think, like you are, you are living your life for yourself, communication also has become more difficult, I guess, within your own families or close friends. Okay, so this is the second question in a row, and we can see that Maren is really starting to struggle with what she should say. Now, the impression that I am getting is that Maren has lots of ideas coming at her, but she does not know which ones to discuss. So what I would recommend for Maren here is to just begin by deciding on a clear, simple answer to the question. So she might want to begin by saying, communication has become worse. Communication has become less common. Or something very simple. And then for the rest of her answer, she would just expand and explain that point. So instead of speaking and kind of coming back to the answer later, start with a clear, simple answer. Once you have that done, you can just explain it and develop on that further.",
