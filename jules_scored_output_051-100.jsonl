So whether the information has already been given or not, the examiner is still going to ask the next question. So if you think that is a little bit weird, well, it is.

They, they prefer talking to their online friends rather than talking to actual friends or families. So, yeah, I think as people started to think, like you are, you are living your life for yourself, communication also has become more difficult, I guess, within your own families or close friends. Okay, so this is the second question in a row, and we can see that Maren is really starting to struggle with what she should say. Now, the impression that I am getting is that Maren has lots of ideas coming at her, but she does not know which ones to discuss. So what I would recommend for Maren here is to just begin by deciding on a clear, simple answer to the question. So she might want to begin by saying, communication has become worse. Communication has become less common. Or something very simple. And then for the rest of her answer, she would just expand and explain that point.

I will not mention their names here. But I think that talent is what is something that can keep a celebrity going for a long time. for example, Taylor Swift.
