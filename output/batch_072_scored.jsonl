I will not mention their names here. But I think that talent is what is something that can keep a celebrity going for a long time. for example, Taylor Swift. I mean, she has been around in the industry for, for 20 years now, actually. And she has been going on very strong. And I think it is solely thanks to her, thanks to her music and thanks to her, all of the talents and all the repertoire that she has. And on the other hand, if you look at some other celebrities, you will notice that some of them have fallen out actually. And you know, and you do not see their names in presses or in headlines anymore. And that I think that definitely a must If the celebrity wants to become if they want to have a sustainable career in this industry then definitely talent is a must So what do you think are the differences between famous people today and those in the past The first thing that comes to me the most striking difference is their presence on social media Back in the days, well, social media was not there at the time. And celebrities at the time mainly used their talent to advertise themselves.
