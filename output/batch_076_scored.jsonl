But in contrast extrovert people they will they really would like to speak like this like face to face Like me I want to sit at a table with my teacher like this because I can acquire new knowledge better Thank you I can definitely tell you an extrovert And the final question for today well done Do people in your country prefer to learn practical skills or academic skills? it is an interesting question. I think Vietnamese people are keen on the practical skill Because, you know, we have a lot of jobs in our country like hair, nail dressing or something like that. And, that professions do not need really, much academic knowledge. And so I think that, we will prefer like practice and we will like have more experience from our practice. so that is why I think that we do not need a lot of knowledge in the books. But we cannot deny that the knowledge from books is really useful. And in the future I will keep reading books to have more skill. Thank you, well done. And that brings us to the end of the test. Well done, congratulations. Fantastic. Well done, Khan. Brilliant, amazing.",
