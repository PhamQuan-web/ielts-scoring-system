I would say, in, in the more effective way to teach, the more effective way to learn, I would say it is, meeting from face to face. Because Zoom, I cannot check whether this student is concentrating in my, in the class or not. So, I just, deliver information in a one way, in a single way from me to the student. But I cannot really get much feedback of whether he or she is understanding what I am saying and whether they are catching up. So I think meeting face-to-face is more effective than online classes.",

Either it could be math, it could be English, it could be reading comprehension whatsoever.

The younger the better, I would say. I was three, four years old when I started learning English. I was late compared to my peers, but still, I am a foreigner, I am a Korean, and I am learning English at a very young age, three, four years old. That would be a very, very quick point of starting to learn English because my other friends that I met in Korea, they started learning English in elementary school or even middle school. So the earlier I think because also very young kids have the capacity have a bigger capacity to fill up their brains with new ideas and new concepts So I think the younger the better Yeah And do you think learning a language is mostly for like job opportunities and education or is it are there other reasons to as I said, if you want to have a good life, you need to be able to speak English. If you speak English, you can go almost anywhere on the planet. So you can travel either it is if it is business or just traveling or some other purpose studying you. The purpose does not matter because communication is established already. So you, if you want to have an international life, if you want to have a lot of opportunities in your life, then you should be able to look beyond Korea, your home country and look to other places. And in order, in order to do that, you need to be able to speak English. that will do us for the test. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Yeah. All right. Okay, so yeah, let us start with the feedback.",
