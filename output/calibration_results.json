Back then I lived in Poland and I shared my flat with a person who came from India. and once he asked me to try like to share a meal with him. Honestly, I was taken a back at first because I was really like I did not expect that. And before that, I had had some unpleasant experience with Indian cuisine. because once I tried their soup and it was so spicy, so hot that I thought I was going to die. But so going back to my point he asked me to share a meal and I was a little bit hesitant. I did not know what to say but I really did not want to you know make him sad. So I said yes even though I was not feeling like trying his food. but I saw how how he was cooking it and it felt like it looked quite good and safe and then once we sat together and started eating I realized how wrong I was because it was so mouthwatering and actually I could not expect anything like that. I do not know the name of the dish, but it was with rice and chicken meat. I guess it is kind of staple food for people who live in India. And it was not that spicy at all. as we were eating and you know sharing some good stories over a meal, I felt so good about being able to explore something new and also connect with my friend on. Okay, I am going to stop you there. Thank you very very much. great. So, we have been talking there about a foreign food that you have tried. I am going to go on and ask some questions related to that next. so.",
