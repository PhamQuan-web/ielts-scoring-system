So I said yes even though I was not feeling like trying his food. but I saw how how he was cooking it and it felt like it looked quite good and safe and then once we sat together and started eating I realized how wrong I was because it was so mouthwatering and actually I could not expect anything like that. I do not know the name of the dish, but it was with rice and chicken meat. I guess it is kind of staple food for people who live in India. And it was not that spicy at all. as we were eating and you know sharing some good stories over a meal, I felt so good about being able to explore something new and also connect with my friend on.

For example, sometimes I, spend a lot of time, I, I end up using the computer, an entire afternoon, an entire Saturday afternoon instead of, spending time with my friends, family, or relatives, or going outside or doing, doing exercises.

Yeah, you should not repeat the same exact same thing that the examiner says. Instead, you can paraphrase some words.

You do not need to speak quickly all the time in all the parts. Like if you want to start answering the question, you can say, well, to answer your question, I can say that there are so many disadvantages to this. To give you some examples, I can say that then you go back to your normal pace. So you should not be in rush to give the answer immediately. You can buy some time using some fillers. Think about what you want to say. The examiner does not need to hear much information from you. You can talk about one idea, cover that idea, give example instead of jumping from one to the other one. So be careful with singular and plural. For example, you said a dish. For example, one of my favorite bands, favorite bands, or in a singing class, In a singing class or even third person s. For example, a dish makes me. A dish makes me. So it is more of singular plural that s. You have problem with the s, you forget to use that. And be careful with the tenses. Like sometimes you were to use simple present but you used a simple past. Maybe you can use present perfect or present perfect continuous more. Like you said, I know them since I was a child. Your friends. I have known them since I was a child.

Maybe at times I could not hear the correct intonation. Raising or lowering your voice and you used to like you stopped and then you started another sentence.

For example, I ask you a question, you want to start your answer, but you need a few seconds to think.

And it was very fascinating to get to know how and how he got successful because if I am not wrong, the CEO in the beginning was selling rice cakes and he got so, you know, he was very, determined to succeed. So, I always find it very, very fascinating. And, however, when it comes to the working environment, I have a lot of friends that work for Samsung and it is very competitive. And, I mean, this is probably my personal opinion, but I, I do think it is, it is not one of the best working environment. it is very hard. it is, it is tough. You have to work for a lot of Howard and even just to get in. I know that the selection, they have like four interviewers. So I do not know if I would work there, but for sure it is a very successful company. And, what I would say is like different from any other company when it comes to Samsung is that they sell everything. Like you can go to a Samsung store and just to buy a TV or, of course a phone and you can also buy a fridge or I do not know, like an air conditioner. So it is something that I always find so, unique and something that is very different from most of other competitors when it comes to, companies and organizations.

And, there was all rubbish and garbages, waste, and the industrial one. It was all over the place. And whenever I go past there, I have to, like, go find a way not to touch all the garbages. And, it was not until there was another way to go to school, then I had to, well, go past that area to go to school. And there was a really beautiful, cute, plants before there was garbages all over the place. So I really pity for the plants and all the birds that, made their nest there, all the flowers.

Since so you know that dyeing material they went to the stream and pollute all the and make the stream turn pink, blue, green. Like it depends on what dye they use for all of their silk and the smell became very horrible and I was really terrifying because of it. Because I had to go to school every day and I went past the stream and it gives me such a terrible feeling. Um, before the moment I had to go to school and it really made my mood went down a little bit. And, uh, there was all rubbish and garbages, waste, and the industrial one. It was all over the place. And whenever I go past there, I have to, um, like, go find a way not to touch all the garbages. And, uh, it was not until there was another way to go to school, then I had to, um, well, go past that area to go to school. And there was a really beautiful, cute, um, plants before there was garbages all over the place. So I really pity for the plants and all the birds that, uh, made their nest there, all the flowers. And, uh, it was such a terrible feeling seeing all the beautiful things got ruined by the waste, the garbage. Yeah. Thank you. And that is the end of your speaking part two. Yeah. So.",

She is very confident, she is very relaxed, she is got a nice level of fluency and a lot of accuracy. Just a few small mistakes with vocabulary so far, and those in particular were when she said, I actually enjoy my birthday party with my friends. Now, what that means is she has two birthday parties and she actually enjoys one of them. But that, of course, is not what she was trying to say. Because later on, you might remember that she said she also enjoys the party with her family. So what she actually meant to say was, I actually prefer the party with my friends. So of course that means she enjoys both of them, but the one with her friends is the one she enjoys most.",

Because Asia is quite, quite close and we are sharing a similar country and we are sharing a similar culture with Korea. So they want to enjoy new environment by taking a flight or by taking traveling. Okay good good And for the final question if if a person travels to a country with a very different culture what kind of problems could they encounter there are a lot of problems could be but I could say the food with some particular things like the cow or the pork someone from the American, someone from Africa, they, they believe some relief. And so they should be careful not to eat some food like cow and pork. But Korea does not have their culture, so they should be careful and Korean restaurants, give some, Korean restaurants need to give some notice for the foreign people to be careful of some food. Alright, okay, so thanks for coming in for the test. we will go to the feedback part now. So I think overall your score is probably going to be about a 5.0. Possibly, now as the speaking exam is subjective, possibly could go up a little bit. But I would say if I were to give you one score now, it would be a 5.0. A lot of good points, a lot of positives. you are very fluent in your answers. Their hesitation was very minimal. Okay, so that is a really good point with your answers. They were also very logical, very easy to understand. Okay, so communication was not really an issue when we were talking. So that is really good. Main issue I think is with grammar. There was too many errors that might just pull you down a bit. Just with, a little bit with tense and a little bit with preposition, preposition, with two and four articles with the and a. For example, in front of place names, you know, the, the soul, you know, the Korea, a little bit was coming in. So, and just a little bit with, the correct tense, you know, if you are talking in the, you know, present continuous, past continuous, there was a little bit of mix up there. So I think the grammar would need to be a little tighter, a little tighter. So I think, you know, because you are speaking quite fluently and quite fast, maybe the grammar is suffering because of that, you know. So I think sometimes students, if you need to slow it down a little, just to tighten the grammar a little bit, can be good. I think it is important to find the balance between the two of them. Yeah, between the two of them. yeah, in terms of like vocabulary was quite wide, you know, it was quite good. some like little bits were, there was a bit of confusion between a couple of words. For example, you talked about traffic in your hometown. So I think you wanted to say that transportation. Yeah, so traffic is kind of negative, but many forms of transportation is more positive.",

You do not use prepositions a lot. I try to write down some of them. For example, you would say you chat them, not saying you chat to them. Or your phrasal verbs sometimes are lacking as well. for example, you would also say almost people. Almost people, that does not make complete sense. Instead, you would say almost all people. Because if you say almost people, that is like not a whole person. But instead you would say for the phrasal verb, almost all people. it is like 90% of people or 95% of people. So it is those little things that you maybe need to start paying attention to as well. also some mistakes like you have known someone for a very old time instead of saying for a very long time. Oh, yeah. Those mistakes could maybe be because of nervousness because it is stressful to take the test. So we make these, I call them silly mistakes, not because you are silly, but because it is a mistake you do not make outside of the test. Like it is, you make it because you are nervous. So it is little things like that. And you said, it was difficulty talking to someone. Instead we would say it is difficult talking to someone. So it is those little mistakes that you need to start paying attention to if you want to get like a 6.5 or 7. It depends on your goal score. The positives, and there are some positives here, you do not pause much. Like you keep talking to me. Usually that is something that takes you from a five score to a six. The fact that you could talk to me continuously. you are not pausing. you are not giving short answers. You can explain to me. Those are positive things. So that is a good thing that you are doing. Also, your answers are pretty natural. it is like we are having an actual conversation. A lot of students get nervous and they would give answers that you would not say the same thing if we were talking in Korean. A silly example I can give you.",

The only piece of feedback that I would give to Saskia here is that at times some of her answers are a little bit short and I feel that she could elaborate a little bit more on her answers. For example, she talked about whether people smile in photographs. And she could say, well yeah, I tend to smile often in photographs, but I suppose it depends on the situation. If it is an active photograph and we are, doing something, then maybe there is no chance to smile. But she did, use a word which I am not that familiar with, but I am not doubting her. It was a blue steel smile. I do not really use that phrase very often, but I think it is probably true.

I'm going to give you a topic and I'd like you to talk about it for one to two minutes. The only piece of feedback that I'd give to Saskia here is that at times some of her answers are a little bit short and I feel that she could elaborate a little bit more on her answers. For example, she talked about whether people smile in photographs. And she could say, well yeah, I tend to smile often in photographs, but I suppose it depends on the situation. If it's an active photograph and we're, um, doing something, then maybe there's no chance to smile. But she did, um, use a word which I'm not that familiar with, but I'm not doubting her. It was a blue steel smile. Um, I don't really use that phrase very often, but I think it's probably true. You can talk about having a steely complexion, which means that um, you're quite uh, stern and you don't always smile. So somebody who has a steely complexion might not smile so often.",

      "transcript": "Yes, I definitely think there is and this is something that I have learned about in one of the courses I am studying at uni too, which was about sports coaching. So how we can give constructive feedback and help our students to learn to learn from their mistakes. And I think it is really important when giving constructive feedback to say something positive first, to make sure you are not too negative and that you do not have a negative tone to your voice, that you are happy. and that you are just generally trying to help them. You want to give off the vibe that you are just trying to help them and not that you are trying to put them down. I think it is one of the worst things when someone's telling you something and you know they are just trying to let you down and trying to make you feel bad about yourself. So I always try and start with something positive and then say, how about we try this or how about next time you do this? I think always phrasing it as a question is also a more sensitive way to approach the topic. In pronunciation there is a feature of, of language which is called the weak form. The weak form is when we do not put the stress on the, the word. And if you go back and listen to Romy, she very often uses the weak form of the sound to, to see, to do. We do not say to see or to do, we say to see, to do. And she uses this weak form with this sound called the schwa, the a sound, the t-t-t, to see, to do, to watch, to sing.

And the problem here is that she is referring to the wrong type of noun. She is referring to a singular noun. And actually she is talking about sandals. And the correct form, the correct pronoun there should be they are easier to wear and they are, they are more comfortable. And so she is mixing up the singulars and plurals there. But then she redeemed herself and she says, because I do a lot of sport. Notice there how she is changed the because to because. Because I do a lot of sport and lots of people think that the IELTS speaking test is a formal test and that you cannot contract words, you cannot shorten words. Well that is actually a myth and the word cause is absolutely appropriate and acceptable in the test. So I encourage you, if you can use it naturally, then definitely think about that. Then she is used words like sneakers. I, I also, she said also I wear sneakers as well. She is actually repeating two cohesive devices there. She is using also and as well together.

I was really pleased to have the picnic and I thought it was really fun because given the circumstances of 2020 with the whole COVID situation I feel like the first thing that I want to do is just to have quality time with my friends and family after not being able to physically see them So I thought like having a picnic is a really good time to actually talk to people again and reconnect instead of just using your phone or like just playing video games. I do not know whether it is a role in playing games or watching like Netflix or something. So I do enjoy having picnics, especially like when you are outside, you can really just like take it all in and enjoy the scenery. And it is just a more chill vibe than just going to a restaurant. And it is more personal for me. Alicia say, after not be able to. After not be able to. I do not quite think I heard after not being able to. Now that is the correct form. After not being able to. So after plus ing. I heard after not be able to. But she did have some really good complexity within her grammar.

She probably spoke a little bit more than she needed to, but great expansion on her answers.",

So in terms of your fluency, it was really good. There was very little hesitation throughout. You were able to speak comfortably and you answered all the questions on the spot. Really good, really good. As was your pronunciation, very clear, very accurate. There were no real issues to point out there. So yeah, fluency, pronunciation, really good, quite good, possibly like above seven. obviously there is a few vocabulary issues. let us just point out a couple just to give some examples. You were talking about your name. Yeah. and you said there were a few other candidates for your name. Like candidates suggest that, suggest to me like people, like presidential candidate would be a different person. But if you are talking about a name, I would say options. There were a few other options, but. You chose minsock. Okay, good. use the word as well disgusting for the the jeans. I probably would not use that word for jeans. Disgusting sounds just a little bit worse, a little bit extreme in that sense. for example, when you are talking about food, like really bad food, you would say disgusting or something that would make your stomach feel bad. Yeah, so yeah, maybe for that one. yeah, the word, just the word furniture is uncountable. So you would never say furnitures, just furniture. Yeah, so you can say a piece of furniture. Yeah, really good. just little, little, bit of word work between packed and crowded. they are very similar actually, you know, but if I were talking about a city, I would say crowded rather than packed. Packed suggests like you are in a room, you know, if you are talking about the subway or you are talking about a, you know, a establishment, you could say it is really packed. Because everyone's inside. Yeah. Yeah. So just a few, few little things with vocabulary there. in terms of grammar, yeah, the tense is usually all right. But I think what lets you down is just some prepositions. You know, just prepositions are kind of missing from a lot of your sentences. For example, you said go to gym, go to the gym, go to the cinema. you said Daegu is at the southern part. So you say in the southern part of Kor.",

Like candidates suggest that, suggest to me like people, like presidential candidate would be a different person. But if you're talking about a name, I would say options. There were a few other options, but. You chose minsock. Okay, good. Um, use the word as well disgusting for the the jeans. I probably wouldn't use that word for jeans. Disgusting sounds just a little bit worse, a little bit extreme in that sense. Um, for example, when you're talking about food, like really bad food, you would say disgusting or something that would make your stomach feel bad. Yeah, so yeah, maybe for that one. Um, yeah, the word, just the word furniture is uncountable. So you would never say furnitures, just furniture. Yeah, so you can say a piece of furniture. Yeah, really good. Um, just little, little, um, bit of word work between packed and crowded. They're very similar actually, you know, but if I were talking about a city, I would say crowded rather than packed. Packed suggests like you're in a room, you know, if you're talking about the subway or you're talking about a, you know, a establishment, you could say it's really packed. Because everyone's inside. Yeah. Yeah. So just a few, few little things with vocabulary there. Um, in terms of grammar, yeah, the tense is usually all right. But I think what lets you down is just some prepositions. You know, just prepositions are kind of missing from a lot of your sentences. For example, you said go to gym, go to the gym, go to the cinema. Um, you said Daegu is at the southern part. So you say in the southern part of Kor.",

So I would say the only thing in the test, because the test is only, you know, maximum 14 minutes and the examiner wants to give you as many questions and ask you like plenty of different topics. So they might like cut your answer short. So I would say conciseness is something that we would want to look at.

Like a person can be strict or maybe like your school has strict rules. But the schedule, we usually describe it as being, you know, tight or busy. And also at times there was some hesitation. And, also some, you, sometimes you would use like, the incorrect part of speech. So instead of saying like, I am an extroverted person, which is like the descriptive word, you would say like, oh, I am an extrovert person. So like extrovert is a noun and person is also a noun. So instead of using two nouns, we should use an adjective and a noun. So extroverted person. also at times, you dropped your articles. So like the and a and an. Sometimes you dropped those, throughout the test, which it is quite a common error and it, with practice and time, it will improve. but yeah. And also I found that sometimes like the connecting words like you said, you like to connect new people instead of connect with new people.",

      "transcript": "Well, I cannot think properly. I cannot control what I am speaking. that is what I feel when I speak, when I am nervous and I speak quickly. -huh. So we deal with a lot of students who speak too quickly. it is totally normal to speak quicker than normal when you are nervous. But let me talk about the impact that that can have on your score. So pronunciation and an examiner must understand all the words that you saying The faster you speak the more difficult it is sometimes So if you had perfect pronunciation and you spoke at that speed it wouldn be so much of a problem but because you not a native English speaker you don have perfect pronunciation with nothing wrong with that But when you combine pronunciation that needs a little bit of work with speaking really quickly it can sometimes cause a problem for the examiner to understand you So one thing that I would say straight away is try to reduce the speed at which, at which you are talking. I know that is extremely difficult for some people. It comes with practice. But if we think about the root cause of the problem, the root cause of the problem is not really the speed of your speech. there is nothing wrong with your mouth. The problem is your brain. you are nervous. so if we can attack that problem, you being nervous, that is going to reduce the speed of it. Cause if we just say slow down, you will get nervous again and you will start to speak more quickly. But if we can reduce the amount of stress that you have, stress is really fear. it is another word for fear. So you are afraid of doing not doing so well on the test. Yeah. Even now my fingers are getting cold. So the best way to combat that is through preparation. So being totally prepared so that it is just like tying your shoelaces or driving a car or riding a bike. you have done it so many times that you, you do not get nervous riding a bike. You know, you do not get nervous tying your shoelaces. you have done it so many times that it just becomes automatic. So I would really recommend that you do a lot more practice and follow the advice that we would give you here today. And that is going to mean that you are just doing something that is routine. you are just doing something that is you are totally expecting the questions coming, you know, not the exact questions, but how you can answer any topic. So that would be one of the main things that I would suggest for you. Part two, you did really, really well. And you spoke for up to two minutes. I had to stop you, which was good. The only problem is the question asked about a famous person. So again, it is not a IQ test or a knowledge test. So you could have picked any famous business person, you know, from China, it could be Jack Ma or from America. It could be Elon Musk or so, you know, someone everybody know, or you know, a little bit about. there is no right or wrong answer. Technically the examiner does not know whether your auntie is famous or not. Because you got a lot of prizes. Yeah, but.",

Fluency is not about speed, really. It is about can you speak without unnatural pauses and hesitations and things like that. You do not have a lot of, I do not know. you are not doing a lot of that. you are just speaking normally. you are speaking very quickly. Listen to the speed that I am speaking at. Like do not have to match me or anything like that. But I do not speak like this when I am speaking to my friends or my family. I would be speaking very quick, quickly compared to this. But because I am speaking to you and I want you to understand what I am saying, I am slowing things down. So fluency is a strength. but answering the question and a little bit of a weakness. vocabulary, you have a very wide ranging vocabulary. you are able to use very topic specific words, and deal with most topics very, very well. so I think vocabulary is probably your biggest strength. Grammar, you do have some little systematic errors like this. If I have enough saving, I would try to be a freelancer for one or two year. it is kind of not that hygiene enough. At least I know three language. it is totally different. But I think many of your grammar errors unusually could be related to pronunciation, which I think is your biggest weakness. Not criticizing you or anything like that. We all have strengths and weaknesses. it is fine. it is interesting you are from Myanmar. because you have, I do not deal with many Burmese students. I have been there and I have, I have taught there, but I, I, there is not a huge number, but it is interesting that you have a weakness that many Vietnamese students have, which is called final sounds. So the final sounds of a word, Vietnamese students, and you do this as well, they will often cut off the last sound. So for example, time becomes Thai. Think. Think. So you would not say think you would think, or thin, or thin, or thin. you are not saying the final sound often. Or sometimes you would miss S's off the ends of words. So that is important sometimes because tenses can often be indicated with the final sound. Like I start or I started. Like the final sign makes the difference in the tense or plural endings can change the grammar. So it is kind of relaxations, you know, so there is sometimes you are mixing those things up as well. So the final signs do affect your grammar score as well, but there are a lot of systematic errors, which means the same error is coming up again and again. So those would be the two areas that I would work on the most focusing on saying every, every syllable, especially the last syllable. Sound could solve a lot of problems because we are solving the pronunciation issue. we are solving the speaking too quickly issue and we are solving a lot of the grammar issues as well because often you are missing the last sign which affects grammar sometimes.",

Well, in rural areas, in urban areas. And finally, that you might talk about age. Young people and old people. it is a great way to set yourself apart and truly capture the examiner's imagination. For example, introvert people. This type of person will keen on learning from home because I think that they will not really enjoy when they meet people outside and talking like this because they will a little bit shy or something like that. They will feel a little bit shy, but good, really good. But in contrast, extrovert people, they will, they really would like to speak like this, like face to face. Like me, I want to, sit at a table with my teacher like this because I can acquire new knowledge better. Thank you. I can definitely tell you are an extrovert. And the final question for today, well done. Do people in your country prefer But to learn practical skills or academic skills. it is an interesting question. So she is buying time there. She would not lose marks for that. Oh, that is an interesting question. She is not hesitating.. She is relaxing and thinking about her ideas just like a native speaker has to. I think Vietnamese people are keen on the practical skill because you know. Just be careful as well with those final s, practical skills. we have a lot of job in our country like hair, nail dressing, or something like that. And, that professions do not need really grammar. Those professions do not require that knowledge. Okay, academic knowledge. It really, much academic knowledge. And so I think that, we will prefer like practice and we will like have more experience from our practice. so that is why I think that we do not need a lot of, knowledge in the books. But we can deny that the knowledge from books is really useful. And in the future, I will keep reading books to have more skills. You see, I think she sort of struggled there with the ideas and putting them together but I like the way that she recovered. She said, I cannot deny the fact that there is something else. So I just love the way that she recovered from that situation there. Thank you, well done. And that brings us to the end of the test. Well done, congratulations. Fantastic. Now you guys, I promise you that the examiner will not clap at the end and often will not shake your hand but they will bring the test to an end. And that is it. that is it.

So I will pause it here because she did some interesting things in this last answer that I want to talk about. But if you would like to know how she could have improved some of those earlier answers, I highly recommend downloading the IELTS Speaking Test Video Companion booklet. you will find some sample answers and techniques that can help you with your speaking test preparation. So in her answer for this question, she responded by saying, that is an interesting question. Listen. I do not aim to be professional, so this is quite an interesting question because. I know a lot of teachers will coach their students to say, that is an interesting question. But often, and frankly, in this case, it is not an interesting question. Instead, she could have just as easily said, no, I used to think about it, but I realized I do not have the talent. And the answer would be just as good. Now, another thing I noticed was the pronunciation of the word photography. I used to think that I want to learn more about photography. So here she got the word stress wrong. It should be photography, not photography. But I still know what she means. And that is the most important thing to remember. In IELTS speaking, you can make mistakes. And in this case, there is just one big error with word stress so far. So it is not a big deal. If it happens a lot, then there could be a bigger impact on her score. I will also point out that she is still not getting all of her past tense verbs quite right yet. I am sure she knows them, but I am not hearing the final d sound in the regular past tense verbs. let us keep watching.",

But if you'd like to know how she could have improved some of those earlier answers, I highly recommend downloading the IELTS Speaking Test Video Companion booklet. You'll find some sample answers and techniques that can help you with your speaking test preparation. So in her answer for this question, she responded by saying, that's an interesting question. Listen. I don't aim to be professional, so this is quite an interesting question because um. I know a lot of teachers will coach their students to say, hmm, that's an interesting question. But often, and frankly, in this case, it's not an interesting question. Instead, she could have just as easily said, no, I used to think about it, but I realized I don't have the talent. And the answer would be just as good. Now, another thing I noticed was the pronunciation of the word photography. I used to think that I want to learn more about photography. So here she got the word stress wrong. It should be photography, not photography. But I still know what she means. And that's the most important thing to remember. In IELTS speaking, you can make mistakes. And in this case, there is just one big error with word stress so far. So it's not a big deal. If it happens a lot, then there could be a bigger impact on her score. I'll also point out that she's still not getting all of her past tense verbs quite right yet. I'm sure she knows them, but I'm not hearing the final d sound in the regular past tense verbs. Let's keep watching.",

I don think I really enjoy studying history in school So I stop here and quickly say that there nothing wrong with let me think But I often tell my students to let their emotions speak Like if she said no not at all I hated it And to add some emotion. it is not wrong to use these expressions like, let me think. But it is not necessary. They can buy you some time, but they do not really do much else. do not get too worried about using them. Either use them or do not, but it is not going to make the big difference on test day. let us continue watching. Why not? I think it is a very dull and dry subject. all we did was memorizing facts and dates, which I was not good at at all. First off, I personally think that history is awesome, but I have to admit I appreciate how Vivian supports and justifies her position in this response. And I also like the expression, which I was not good at at all. Here she had great grammar. there is no issues with her irregular past tense verbs. I would say that so far she is achieving at least a score of six for grammar, but for a seven I am not totally convinced yet. It is possible. In IELTS speaking, the past simple subject verb agreement and articles are used in almost every sentence. So if you are aiming for a seven, these need to be a bit more under control.",

In terms of grammar accuracy, there are still a few too many basic errors, which ultimately is going to make a seven difficult to reach.

You also might have noticed that Vivian said if the culture values family relationships. Listen again. If the culture values family relationships, I think people would prefer living with their family members to spend more time with them and also to help each other.

For instance, grandparents enjoy spending time with their grandchildren and it is handy to have grandparents looking after the small kids when the parents are out working.

But it is just part of your culture, especially with teachers and education to not say, this is exactly how I feel about that.

      "transcript": "Because to you, it sounds totally fine because you have been speaking, let us call it Filipino English for many, many years. And no one has ever said that is an error. But when you do the IELTS test, again, you are moving to an English speaking country. They will pick up on those errors that you are completely unaware of. So for example, staff was not that much helpful. It should have been the staff were not very helpful. Or every household in Philippines, there is really gardens. Instead of in every household in the Philippines, there are gardens. I know exactly what you are saying. Yeah. there is no problem with meaning, but there are a lot of those little, for example, subject verb agreement issues, article issues. there is some tense inconsistencies. So the way that the IELTS examiner will think about your grammar score is number of sentences with or without errors. So for example, let us say just using round numbers, let us say you spoke 100 sentences. If more than 50 of those sentences had grammatical errors in them, more than half, you would get about six for grammar. If more than 50 of those sentences had zero errors, those would be known as error-free sentences, you would get at least a band seven. In my opinion, there were more small, just small little errors in most sentences, so you would get a band six for grammar. This is extremely common for Filipino students, and this is one of the main reasons why they get 6.5. So their fluency is great. They answer the questions. Their vocabulary is quite good. Their pronunciation is excellent. But this grammar issue brings them down. That should be your main area of focus. So overall, you would be in and around 6.5 or 7 overall. Now for most people, 7 is, is, great for, from whatever they need to do. but 6.5 is often not good. depends on what you want to do. My, advice would be to really focus on grammar and that can be quite difficult because as I said before, a lot of these issues are ingrained because you have been making those errors for years and you, you do not know you have, you are even making them. It does not affect communication. So it is not a huge issue. It just depends on what score you are hoping to get.",

So, the question in part two was describe an occasion when somebody gave you positive advice or suggestions about your work or study. So, that would be a case where, let us say, you were working on a project or you were studying for an exam or taking a course. Yeah. And somebody gave you advice on how to improve, how to be better. I think your answer was not completely, ticking the boxes of what we wanted to know. For example, who the person is, what they said, how the advice affected you. So, I think you were, you talked about your friend saying that you have to be confident, which is not completely wrong, but it was maybe not specific enough. So, that is also maybe something that as you improve your vocabulary, it would be easier for you to understand these questions. So, I think if I had to give you a score, I would say about a 4.0. Oh.

Even though a 4.0 is not a particularly high score, I think the fact that you are confident means that you will be able to take this feedback in a good way. Yeah.

      "transcript": "Let us jump straight into part one of the speaking test. In part one, the examiner will begin by introducing themselves, then asking you to state your name and show your identification. Then, they will ask you three sets of questions about familiar topics. The first set usually asks you general questions about yourself, such as your work or study, your home, or the place where you live. The second and third sets are personal questions about familiar topics like the food you like, your hobbies, people you spend time with, and so on. you will get up to 12 questions in this part, and it is important to know how to answer them well in the time given. But do not worry, today you will only get four part one questions. Here are my tips for part one. First, give extended answers. As a general rule, I would say try to talk for around 20 seconds for each answer. that is the equivalent of about two to three written sentences. Try to add more information to your response, such as giving an example or a reason to explain your answer. Also, make sure your answers have complete sentences. do not just give single word answers. Finally, there are no right or wrong answers to the questions, but what you say should answer the question. Now, it is time for you to try part one. I am going to ask you one set of questions, and you will have 20 seconds to answer each. And to get the most out of today's practice test, I recommend you record your answers so you can go back and check how you went.",

I am going to talk about a time when I really enjoyed sharing a meal with a friend. It happened about a year ago when I met up with my old friend, Alex. we would been close in university, but after graduating, life got busy and we lost touch. In fact, it had been almost 3 years since we would last seen each other. So, we decided to catch up over dinner. We chose a cozy Chinese restaurant in the city that specialized in hot pot. It was a great choice because hot pot is such a social meal. You sit around a steaming pot cooking your own food and it naturally creates conversation. The atmosphere in the restaurant was warm and lively with the sound of bubbling broth and people chatting all around us. We ordered a vegetarian hot pot which was perfect because Alex is vegetarian. There was a huge variety of fresh ingredients, mushrooms, tofu, leafy greens, and noodles. I remember the spicy broth being absolutely delicious, and we kept adding more ingredients as we talked. The whole experience felt interactive, which made the meal even more enjoyable.",

But sometimes you think so deeply about it that you are thinking about the next thing to say, you do not have a fluency problem because your English is bad. Some people do. So, I am sure you know people, your friends or family that do not speak English to the level that you do and and they are searching for the correct adjective or the correct tense. you are not doing that at all. You are doing what we call searching for ideas. Again, I do not think it is a huge issue. you are quite a unique candidate in that if we tried to make you better, it might make you worse. Yeah. I do not understand that. Yeah. So if we tell you do not think and just speak the first thing that pops into your head, that would be my advice for most students. Yeah. But for you, I think that your style of communication actually is improved by thinking deeply about it. But on test day, I would not try and think of the absolute best idea. I would think of what is the easiest idea for me to talk about. And that will improve your fluency a little bit. I would say your fluency is at a band eight because of that reason that you do pause quite a lot. and if I give you a band nine, everybody in the comments will be like, he pauses too. But the the the key for people back home is that what it says in the marking criteria is unnatural pausing. I have gotten to know you today, so I know that the pausing is not unnatural. it is actually who you are. But an examiner on test day does not know you at all. and they might think, well, he he does not know the right adjective. He does not know the right tense. You know, for most people in the world, a band eight is extremely high and is good enough to move to any country in the world. Band 9 is just showing off. You know, band I am humble. I need a nine. Grammar, you have enough grammatical structures to talk about anything. So some people if you ask them to talk about the past and compare it to the future they do not know really how to do it or compare two things they do not really you have no issues whatsoever. You do make little grammatical errors sometimes. So for example this is a mistake that I actually make more simple instead of simpler or you said open for instead of open to. So like a little preposition error but native English speakers make those little slips too. I make those little slips. So what it says in the marking criteria for band nine is the mistakes that you make are slips like that and they are very infrequent. So I think your grammar is at a band nine. Same with your vocabulary. Sometimes you could use a word that is a little bit more advanced. If I give you the advice of improve the complexity, you might make more mistakes. I think you are on the border of a band nine for vocabulary. So I think overall you are at a band like 8.5. As I said before, band 9 is less than 1%. Band 8.5, I think, is.",

I would think of what's the easiest idea for me to talk about. And that will improve your fluency a little bit. I would say your fluency is at a band eight because of that reason that you do pause quite a lot. Um, and if I give you a band nine, everybody in the comments will be like, he pauses too. But the the the key for people back home is that what it says in the marking criteria is unnatural pausing. I've gotten to know you today, so I know that the pausing is not unnatural. It's actually who you are. But an examiner on test day doesn't know you at all. and they might think, well, he he doesn't know the right adjective. He doesn't know the right tense. You know, for most people in the world, a band eight is extremely high and is good enough to move to any country in the world. Band 9 is just showing off. You know, band I'm humble. I need a nine. Grammar, you have enough grammatical structures to talk about anything. So some people if you ask them to talk about the past and compare it to uh the future they don't know really how to do it or compare two things they don't really you have no issues whatsoever. You do make little grammatical errors sometimes. So for example this is a mistake that I actually make more simple instead of simpler or you said open for instead of open to. So like a little preposition error but native English speakers make those little slips too. I make those little slips. So what it says in the marking criteria for band nine is the mistakes that you make are slips like that and they're very infrequent. So I think your grammar is at a band nine. Same with your vocabulary. Sometimes you could use a word that is a little bit more advanced. If I give you the advice of improve the complexity, you might make more mistakes. I think you're on the border of a band nine for vocabulary. So I think overall you're at a band like 8.5. As I said before, band 9 is less than 1%. Band 8.5, I think, is.",

For example, in the second part, when talking about the book that I found useful, at the beginning I said, \"I find this useful.\" It was only later that I remembered and repeated \"I found,\" which led to a grammatical error. So, if we practice and refine our speech, we will be able to speak accurately and precisely. You do not need perfect grammar; nowadays, a slightly more basic and standardized grammar is sufficient.",

So while driving, she was giving me directions. But at one point, I did not feel like it was enough. So I kind of took the phone from her and in I in my way took it on my hand and was turning the map around east and west, swiping up and down trying to understand where it was. And that is when she jokingly said to me like you always spin the map around and look like in olden times when people had maps in their hand they used to hold it northwest and spin it around and look and I started laughing as well because it is kind of true and that moment that joke kind of made me realize it is very true how technology has changed my life. If I did not have Google maps with me I would be re actually holding a real life map in front of me and I would be actually spinning it around as I was driving. I do not have to do that now. I drive and the map kind of sometimes even tells me 400 meters to the right, turn left, go to this intersection, keep on straight. I do not have to look at the map all the time. It tells me and I like I can spin it much easier as well. it is not a huge piece of paper I have to spin. it is just a small screen that I can turn around with my fingers. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much.",

I would suggest animations stay away from the Big Ben theory no matter what people say because that those are really difficult and also the two girls and they they keep saying like that is the greatest thing but for me I think it is a good TV show the shows I just list but it might not be really good for you. You know you should watch something that is more regarding daily lives. I I mean there is a one show called Brothers and Sisters. I really love that show. it is really good. yeah. you can start watching those like I said you know more life related kind of TV series instead of those hot TV shows might not really suit you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you know one question that I get is &gt;&gt; from a lot of students is like there is no native speakers around. there is no one for me to practice with who is a native speaker.

You know you should watch something that is more um regarding daily lives. I I mean there's a one show called Brothers and Sisters. I really love that show. Um it's really good. Um yeah. Um you can start um watching those like I said you know more uh life related kind of uh TV series um instead of uh those hot TV shows might not really suit you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you know one question that I get is um &gt;&gt; from a lot of students is like there's no native speakers around. There's no one for me to practice with who's a native speaker. And and your advice is well actually you don't need a native speaker. There's a whole world of content at your fingertips.",

Feedback time. the notes that I made were mostly about like really good vocabulary. &gt;&gt; words like whipping up, trepidation, &gt;&gt; safe or safe to say, &gt;&gt; newfound to tap into, swayed, &gt;&gt; those are very like how can I say native &gt;&gt; native speaker kind of expressions to use. So I would give you a very good grade for vocabulary. your fluency was very good. &gt;&gt; Here or there you paused. &gt;&gt; However, there is a difference in how we grade pausing. Like there is pausing when you do not know the English word &gt;&gt; and there is pausing to think. &gt;&gt; In your case, that was pausing to think. &gt;&gt; Like we could pick up the difference there. You were not like fishing for words. Yeah, we are trying to think of actually what to respond to the question. So, &gt;&gt; usually they mark pausing down if it is not a natural pause, but I think in your case it was natural. You were thinking, &gt;&gt; okay, &gt;&gt; of responding to the question. You were not looking for for the words. So, yeah, overall very positive. if I had to grade you, it would definitely be in the 8 to 8.5 range. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, very natural sounding, very native sounding. You you are very confident as well when you speak. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, I think that is a there is not a lot of critical feedback that I can give you because you did not &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; you did not make grammar mistakes. No, I am pretty sure I I make tons of grammar mistakes. Trust me, &gt;&gt; not in this case. &gt;&gt; I did not pick up on anything. &gt;&gt; I think the I would not say they were grammar mistakes that you made. I think it was just more like trying to express yourself. Like for example, you would start with half a sentence and then you would cut and make a new sentence. &gt;&gt; So I would not personally I would not classify that as a grammar mistake. that is more like thinking out loud. &gt;&gt; It can depend on how the examiner wants to interpret that, but I would not interpret that as a mistake. that is you rephrasing &gt;&gt; or correcting yourself. &gt;&gt; So yeah, I think I would like again I said definitely in the 8 to 8.5 range. So that was very well done. &gt;&gt; Well, that is good. Thank you. I am actually nervous about Yeah, &gt;&gt; you did well under those circumstances then. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.",

So of course I lost my temper and I started shouting at my husband and he started shouting back and normally he does not do that but I knew I was in the wrong so it was time to apologize.

This is the act of politeness. saying thank you. It does feel like the candidate is just listing different ways and you might think well you know that is what the question demands is not it like how do people show politeness surely you just give a list of different things but it is not really the best way of developing think it is much better to just you know list one or two I think you know like in most countries people show politeness by giving up their seat on the metro especially to you know a disabled person or a pregnant woman or an old person something like this but I think The thing in my culture that really stands out is like how we have polite language. Like the type of language we use with young kids is very different to the type of language that we use with older people. And I do not know, maybe that is the same in many languages. But I do not know, in my first language, it just feels like through some of this vocab and grammar that we use, it kind of signals some high level of respect for older people. And that would be a better answer because we are not just listing. we are we are trying to give some extra details. &gt;&gt; sending flowers or thank you cards. &gt;&gt; Okay, we can stop listing now. &gt;&gt; treating people with food or just &gt;&gt; Yeah, we just have list list. I do not know inviting them for for dinner could be &gt;&gt; yeah politen I mean tricky and again this is seems to be an instant where and it is a natural reaction candidates are looking for the right answer instead of talking through. Now I think what is going on in arena's mind is I I am not really sure how we show politeness. So maybe we do this and then we do this and then we do this and then we do this and then we do this and then we do this. Whereas maybe the best approach to say maybe the best approach or a better approach would be to be honest and say how do we show politeness?

      "transcript": "Because to you it sounds totally fine because you have been speaking let us call it Filipino English for many many years and no one has ever said that is an error but when you do the IELTS test again you are moving to an English-speaking country they will pick up on those errors that you are completely unaware of so for example staff was not that much helpful it should have been the staff were not very helpful or every household in Philippines there is really gardens Instead of in every household in the Philippines, there are gardens. I know exactly what you are saying. &gt;&gt; there is no problem with meaning, but there are a lot of those little, for example, subjectverb agreement issues, article issues. there is some tense inconsistencies. So, the way that the IELTS examiner will think about your grammar score is number of sentences with or without errors. So for let us say just using round numbers, let us say you spoke 100 sentences. If more than 50 of those sentences had grammatical errors in them, more than half, you would get a band six for grammar. If more than 50 of those sentences had zero errors, those would be known as error-free sentences. You would get at least a band seven. In my opinion, there were more small just small little errors in most sentences. So you would get a band six for grammar. This is extremely common for Filipino students and this is one of the main reasons why they get 6.5. So their fluency is great. They answer the questions. Their vocabulary is quite good. Their pronunciation is excellent but this grammar issue brings them down. That should be your main area of focus. So overall you would be in and around 6.5 or seven overall. Now, for most people, seven is is great for from whatever they need to do. but 6.5 is often not good. depends on what you want to do. My advice would be to really focus on grammar and that can be quite difficult because as I said before a lot of these issues are ingrained because you have been making those errors for years and you you do not know you you are even making them. It does not affect communication so it is not a huge issue. It it just depends on what score you are hoping to get.",

      "transcript_original": "because to you it sounds totally fine because you've been speaking let's call it Filipino English for many many years and no one has ever said that's an error but when you do the IELTS test again you're moving to an English-speaking country they will pick up on those errors that you are completely unaware of so for example staff wasn't that much helpful it should have been the staff weren't very helpful or every household in Philippines there's really gardens Instead of in every household in the Philippines, there are gardens. I know exactly what you're saying. &gt;&gt; There's no problem with meaning, but there are a lot of those little, for example, subjectverb agreement issues, article issues. There's some tense inconsistencies. So, the way that the IELTS examiner will think about your grammar score is number of sentences with or without errors. So for let's say just using round numbers, let's say you spoke 100 sentences. If more than 50 of those sentences had grammatical errors in them, more than half, you would get a band six for grammar. If more than 50 of those sentences had zero errors, those would be known as error-free sentences. You would get at least a band seven. In my opinion, there were more small just small little errors in most sentences. So you would get a band six for grammar.

Overall, Ni did a fantastic performance and she really got into the the mood and the shape of things at the end. For me, her pronunciation overall was very good. I think that is probably her strongest of the four marking criteria. Pronunciation was the best. Next, I would like to compliment her fluency. Overall, there was a little bit of hesitation in these answers, but I do not think that it would affect her score too much because overall it was good. In terms of grammar, there were a few past tense mistakes, but overall, I would say it was pretty good as well. For me, the most important thing for N to work on is to try and maybe improve her vocabulary. There was quite a lot of simple vocabulary in her answers, although she did use some beautiful phrases as well. Help me to shape and determine my future. It depends on personality. So, there were a few good phrases in there as well, but for me, vocabulary would be the thing that I would encourage N to work on most.

So you said well there are several factors first of all and then you would introduce the first idea and then you would develop it probably with an example and then you would say second of all and it's almost like if I were to see a transcript of your answers I'd be very impressed because I could read it and immediately pinpoint what you were talking about at every second of your of your conversation.",

So this is an interesting one. Remember in part three you don't really want to be talking about yourself too much. So try to if you can talk about wider society. So I liked it at the start she referred to people or students need to manage their time but then we went a little bit talking about herself. She she started talking about herself. Um, moreover, if possible, it did ask what skills. So, I would have liked another one.

Using \"in my perspective\" is not entirely correct. From my perspective, you used the phrase \"to be honest,\" or when you answer \"yes\" to a yes/no question, instead of just saying \"yes,\" you would say \"yes definitely.\" that is also a very good way to answer. So that is an overview of fluency and grammar. Regarding my pronunciation, my intonation is very good. I use variations in pitch to express my emotions. However, after listening for a while, it still sounds a bit flat. So, I am trying to practice at home to slightly increase the pitch, making it higher and lower. For example, \"Oh, I work in marketing and I need to research customer insights,\" it needs to go higher and lower. Currently, I do that, but the range is a bit low and short. If I increase the pitch, I will reduce it in the exam room. It will sound much better. Okay. And regarding pronunciation, I can clearly hear the words and use linking sounds \u2013 that is a plus. For example, I can say \"someone who cares about cares about,\" or \" gives me.\" I can pronounce the third-person singular form of the verb correctly \u2013 that is a plus. But I also make some mistakes with word formation. For example... Like \" negotiate,\" I heard you pronounce it differently earlier, I do not remember exactly how, but it should be \" negotiate.\" Then, you mispronounced \"purchase\" a few times, so it should be \" purchase purchase.\" Okay, the second sound is \"-,\" so the word \"decide\" should be pronounced \"-,\" not \" decided.\" Okay, pay attention.",

I should have said this, I shouldn't have done that, I should have done this. It's a test. we and it always happens unfortunately. Um so yeah, in terms of language ability, the candidate certainly can get a nine. It's just a question of whether she can hold it together on test day. I I don't know if she's planning to take another IELTS test soon. I know she's done some IELTS tests in the past. Um I would say, you know, on the one hand, I would say forget about the nine. You don't need the nine. You don't need to prove anything to anyone. Um you you've mastered the English language. doesn't make any difference whether you get a nine or not. But I know if I was in her position as also an an uber competitive person, if I knew I could get the nine, I would want that nine. And so I can understand if the candidate wants to um wants to go down that road of getting the nine. Examiners generally if they can avoid giving a nine, they prefer to give 8.5s. Um but yeah, an amazing performance. Very very well done. 8.5. The candidate is at C2 level for me. But you let me know what you think.",

So in the IO speaking part two, I am going to give you a topic and you have to describe your favorite film in 2 minutes. you are going to have 1 minute for your reparation. To be honest, one of my favorite film is The Conjuring. I first watch it at home with my cousins about two years ago. it is a horror film and direct by James W. it is also based on real life paranormal investigations by Ed and Lauren Warren. The story follows a family who moved an old fame house and begins to experience terrifying supernatural events. the warren who are god hunters. They try to remove evil spirits that haunting the house. I really love this film because it is not just about scary, but it is also very wellmade. The acting, lighting, and sound are incredible. So, it is creating a strong sense of suspense. And like I was mentioned, it is not just about scary. They not only rely on jump scares, but it is build psychological tension throughout the strong. So the film is made me feel very chills when I watch it and and I really admire how skill how skillfully it was directed. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Yeah.",

One more thing as well when you were in the part two I loved how you you kind of showed emotion about when you talked about your friend. You put your arm around them when they were overcome with emotion and you you helped them to to be more fruitful. So that was really impressive.
