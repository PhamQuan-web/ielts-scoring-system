I believe a little change of scenery would give me a much better feeling since I am fed up with my work. For that reason, I would choose hiking as a future hobby.

You did not realize, you did not notice. I always like that and I am, and when I am talking fast and I am nervous and I am, do not think about what I am saying. Maybe you should speak slower. Yeah. You do not need to speak quickly all the time in all the parts. Like if you want to start answering the question, you can say, well, to answer your question, I can say that there are so many disadvantages to this. To give you some examples, I can say that then you go back to your normal pace. So you should not be in rush to give the answer immediately. You can buy some time using some fillers. Think about what you want to say. The examiner does not need to hear much information from you. You can talk about one idea, cover that idea, give example instead of jumping from one to the other one. So be careful with singular and plural. For example, you said a dish. For example, one of my favorite bands, favorite bands, or in a singing class, In a singing class or even third person s. For example, a dish makes me. A dish makes me. So it is more of singular plural that s. You have problem with the s, you forget to use that. And be careful with the tenses. Like sometimes you were to use simple present but you used a simple past. Maybe you can use present perfect or present perfect continuous more. Like you said, I know them since I was a child. Your friends. I have known them since I was a child. I was, or we have been going out since so many years ago. So you can use more tenses, a variety of tenses. And finally, your pronunciation. In your pronunciation, I could not really notice many lapses or pronunciation mistakes. it was generally okay, but, there was a mixed control because you were talking so fast. Maybe at times I could not hear the correct intonation. Raising or lowering your voice and you used to like you stopped and then you started another sentence. So you should know how to finish a sentence and then start the other one. Finish one sentence and then start the next one. Do not jump from the middle of the first sentence to the beginning of the next sentence. that is a very good, that is a very, very good score. I can say you can, you are able to get a 7.5 or even 8. Just try to use more complex expressions. Structures, grammatical structures. Only use the words and vocabularies that you are totally sure about.

      "transcript": "It is depending on case. if people have enough time to go abroad like Europe or America, they prepare to America or Europe except Asia. Because Asia is quite, quite close and we are sharing a similar country and we are sharing a similar culture with Korea. So they want to enjoy new environment by taking a flight or by taking traveling. Okay good good And for the final question if if a person travels to a country with a very different culture what kind of problems could they encounter there are a lot of problems could be but I could say the food with some particular things like the cow or the pork someone from the American, someone from Africa, they, they believe some relief. And so they should be careful not to eat some food like cow and pork. But Korea does not have their culture, so they should be careful and Korean restaurants, give some, Korean restaurants need to give some notice for the foreign people to be careful of some food. Alright, okay, so thanks for coming in for the test. we will go to the feedback part now. So I think overall your score is probably going to be about a 5.0. Possibly, now as the speaking exam is subjective, possibly could go up a little bit. But I would say if I were to give you one score now, it would be a 5.0. A lot of good points, a lot of positives. you are very fluent in your answers. Their hesitation was very minimal. Okay, so that is a really good point with your answers. They were also very logical, very easy to understand. Okay, so communication was not really an issue when we were talking. So that is really good. Main issue I think is with grammar. There was too many errors that might just pull you down a bit. Just with, a little bit with tense and a little bit with preposition, preposition, with two and four articles with the and a. For example, in front of place names, you know, the, the soul, you know, the Korea, a little bit was coming in. So, and just a little bit with, the correct tense, you know, if you are talking in the, you know, present continuous, past continuous, there was a little bit of mix up there. So I think the grammar would need to be a little tighter, a little tighter. So I think, you know, because you are speaking quite fluently and quite fast, maybe the grammar is suffering because of that, you know. So I think sometimes students, if you need to slow it down a little, just to tighten the grammar a little bit, can be good. I think it is important to find the balance between the two of them. Yeah, between the two of them. yeah, in terms of like vocabulary was quite wide, you know, it was quite good. some like little bits were, there was a bit of confusion between a couple of words. For example, you talked about traffic in your hometown. So I think you wanted to say that transportation. Yeah, so traffic is kind of negative, but many forms of transportation is more positive.",

      "transcript_original": "Uh, it's depending on case. Um, if people have enough time to go abroad like Europe or America, they prepare to America or Europe except Asia. Because Asia is quite, quite close and we are sharing a similar country and we are sharing a similar culture with Korea. So they want to enjoy new environment by taking a flight or by taking traveling. Okay good good And for the final question if um if a person travels to a country with a very different culture what kind of problems could they encounter Um there are a lot of problems could be but I could say the food with some particular things like the cow or the pork Um, someone from the American, uh, someone from Africa, they, uh, they believe some relief. And so they should be careful not to eat some food like cow and pork. But Korea doesn't have their culture, so they should be careful and Korean restaurants, uh, give some, Korean restaurants need to give some notice for the foreign people to be careful of some food. Alright, okay, so thanks for coming in for the test. We'll go to the feedback part now. So I think overall your score is probably going to be about a 5.0. Possibly, now as the speaking exam is subjective, possibly could go up a little bit. But I'd say if I were to give you one score now, it would be a 5.0. A lot of good points, a lot of positives. You're very fluent in your answers. Their hesitation was very minimal. Okay, so that's a really good point with your answers. They were also very logical, very easy to understand. Okay, so communication was not really an issue when we were talking. So that's really good. Main issue I think is with grammar. There was too many errors that might just pull you down a bit. Just with, a little bit with tense and a little bit with preposition, preposition, with two and four articles with the and a. For example, in front of place names, you know, the, the soul, you know, the Korea, a little bit was coming in. So, and just a little bit with, um, the correct tense, you know, if you're talking in the, you know, present continuous, past continuous, there was a little bit of mix up there.

You do not use prepositions a lot. I try to write down some of them. For example, you would say you chat them, not saying you chat to them. Or your phrasal verbs sometimes are lacking as well. for example, you would also say almost people. Almost people, that does not make complete sense. Instead, you would say almost all people. Because if you say almost people, that is like not a whole person. But instead you would say for the phrasal verb, almost all people. it is like 90% of people or 95% of people. So it is those little things that you maybe need to start paying attention to as well. also some mistakes like you have known someone for a very old time instead of saying for a very long time. Oh, yeah. Those mistakes could maybe be because of nervousness because it is stressful to take the test. So we make these, I call them silly mistakes, not because you are silly, but because it is a mistake you do not make outside of the test. Like it is, you make it because you are nervous. So it is little things like that. And you said, it was difficulty talking to someone. Instead we would say it is difficult talking to someone. So it is those little mistakes that you need to start paying attention to if you want to get like a 6.5 or 7. It depends on your goal score. The positives, and there are some positives here, you do not pause much. Like you keep talking to me. Usually that is something that takes you from a five score to a six. The fact that you could talk to me continuously. you are not pausing. you are not giving short answers. You can explain to me. Those are positive things. So that is a good thing that you are doing.

And I don't remember exactly what she says but you'll notice that she links all her words together and and chunks them and this idea of pronunciation chunking is really important in in the test.",

      "transcript": "Yes, I definitely think there is and this is something that I have learned about in one of the courses I am studying at uni too, which was about sports coaching. So how we can give constructive feedback and help our students to learn to learn from their mistakes. And I think it is really important when giving constructive feedback to say something positive first, to make sure you are not too negative and that you do not have a negative tone to your voice, that you are happy. and that you are just generally trying to help them. You want to give off the vibe that you are just trying to help them and not that you are trying to put them down. I think it is one of the worst things when someone's telling you something and you know they are just trying to let you down and trying to make you feel bad about yourself. So I always try and start with something positive and then say, how about we try this or how about next time you do this? I think always phrasing it as a question is also a more sensitive way to approach the topic. In pronunciation there is a feature of, of language which is called the weak form. The weak form is when we do not put the stress on the, the word. And if you go back and listen to Romy, she very often uses the weak form of the sound to, to see, to do. We do not say to see or to do, we say to see, to do. And she uses this weak form with this sound called the schwa, the a sound, the t-t-t, to see, to do, to watch, to sing.

And the problem here is that she is referring to the wrong type of noun. She is referring to a singular noun. And actually she is talking about sandals. And the correct form, the correct pronoun there should be they are easier to wear and they are, they are more comfortable. And so she is mixing up the singulars and plurals there.

Because I do a lot of sport and lots of people think that the IELTS speaking test is a formal test and that you cannot contract words, you cannot shorten words. Well that is actually a myth and the word cause is absolutely appropriate and acceptable in the test. So I encourage you, if you can use it naturally, then definitely think about that.

Like, they are beautiful but just not so suitable for the situation. So probably you just need to choose the most comfortable shoes for that situation. Some really nice features of her language here. But again, a few problems with, the wrong subject and verb. She said, the most important thing for me is comfortable. And what she is done there is she is used an adjective in the place where there should have been a noun. The most important thing for me is that they are comfortable, not it is comfortable. So, and also, that would be a complex sentence. You could replace it with a noun and you could say, The most important thing for me is comfort. And comfort is a singular word there, so you could just use the word is. You have two choices. The most important thing for me is that they are comfortable. They are comfortable. Or the most important thing for me is comfort. Two different choices. You can decide, does not make any difference. Maybe the longer one, that they are comfortable, is more complex grammatically. So maybe you want to choose that type. you, she also said but when you wear it, again it is a when sentence which is nice but she mixes up the it and they. It should be when you wear them.

So probably you just need to choose the most comfortable shoes for that situation. Some really nice features of her language here. But again, a few problems with, um, the wrong subject and verb. She said, the most important thing for me is comfortable. And what she's done there is she's used an adjective in the place where there should have been a noun. The most important thing for me is that they are comfortable, not it is comfortable. So, and also, um, that would be a complex sentence. You could replace it with a noun and you could say, The most important thing for me is comfort. And comfort is a singular word there, so you could just use the word is. You have two choices. The most important thing for me is that they are comfortable. They are comfortable. Or the most important thing for me is comfort. Two different choices. You can decide, doesn't make any difference. Maybe the longer one, that they are comfortable, is more complex grammatically. So maybe you want to choose that type. Um, you, she also said but when you wear it, again it's a when sentence which is nice but she mixes up the it and they. It should be when you wear them. And I think that she, she makes good expansion on her answers but again lots of little grammar mistakes that are peeking through. In the next part of the test I'm going to give you a topic and I would like you to speak for one to two minutes. Here is your paper and pencil. Thank you. You have one minute to prepare.

Oh, look, I'm horrible at Chinese history, but I think we do have like clothes, traditional clothes, but um, I've personally never worn them because I've never found the right occasion to wear it. But mainly in a formal event, we stopped using traditional Chinese clothes. It's more westernized and we wear suits and ties just like everyone else. Okay, now are some particular pronunciation problems. And it goes back again to this thirst sound. Kevin is struggling a little bit with the thirst sound. So, I know this word is really difficult for Chinese speakers. Clothes. Clothes. Kevin says clothes, clothes. The correct pronunciation is clothes, clothes. If you can see my tongue, clothes. Really, really difficult. He said mainly worn by female. Female would be singular and you should say females. So a couple of mistakes starting to creep through here. He's still doing really well.

So in terms of your fluency, it was really good. There was very little hesitation throughout. You were able to speak comfortably and you answered all the questions on the spot. Really good, really good. As was your pronunciation, very clear, very accurate. There were no real issues to point out there. So yeah, fluency, pronunciation, really good, quite good, possibly like above seven. obviously there is a few vocabulary issues. let us just point out a couple just to give some examples. You were talking about your name. Yeah. and you said there were a few other candidates for your name. Like candidates suggest that, suggest to me like people, like presidential candidate would be a different person. But if you are talking about a name, I would say options. There were a few other options, but. You chose minsock. Okay, good. use the word as well disgusting for the the jeans. I probably would not use that word for jeans. Disgusting sounds just a little bit worse, a little bit extreme in that sense. for example, when you are talking about food, like really bad food, you would say disgusting or something that would make your stomach feel bad. Yeah, so yeah, maybe for that one. yeah, the word, just the word furniture is uncountable. So you would never say furnitures, just furniture. Yeah, so you can say a piece of furniture. Yeah, really good. just little, little, bit of word work between packed and crowded. they are very similar actually, you know, but if I were talking about a city, I would say crowded rather than packed. Packed suggests like you are in a room, you know, if you are talking about the subway or you are talking about a, you know, a establishment, you could say it is really packed. Because everyone's inside. Yeah. Yeah. So just a few, few little things with vocabulary there. in terms of grammar, yeah, the tense is usually all right. But I think what lets you down is just some prepositions. You know, just prepositions are kind of missing from a lot of your sentences.

Like a person can be strict or maybe like your school has strict rules. But the schedule, we usually describe it as being, you know, tight or busy. And also at times there was some hesitation. And, also some, you, sometimes you would use like, the incorrect part of speech. So instead of saying like, I am an extroverted person, which is like the descriptive word, you would say like, oh, I am an extrovert person. So like extrovert is a noun and person is also a noun. So instead of using two nouns, we should use an adjective and a noun. So extroverted person. also at times, you dropped your articles. So like the and a and an. Sometimes you dropped those, throughout the test, which it is quite a common error and it, with practice and time, it will improve. but yeah.

      "transcript": "Well, I cannot think properly. I cannot control what I am speaking. that is what I feel when I speak, when I am nervous and I speak quickly. -huh. So we deal with a lot of students who speak too quickly. it is totally normal to speak quicker than normal when you are nervous. But let me talk about the impact that that can have on your score. So pronunciation and an examiner must understand all the words that you saying The faster you speak the more difficult it is sometimes So if you had perfect pronunciation and you spoke at that speed it wouldn be so much of a problem but because you not a native English speaker you don have perfect pronunciation with nothing wrong with that But when you combine pronunciation that needs a little bit of work with speaking really quickly it can sometimes cause a problem for the examiner to understand you So one thing that I would say straight away is try to reduce the speed at which, at which you are talking. I know that is extremely difficult for some people. It comes with practice. But if we think about the root cause of the problem, the root cause of the problem is not really the speed of your speech. there is nothing wrong with your mouth. The problem is your brain. you are nervous. so if we can attack that problem, you being nervous, that is going to reduce the speed of it. Cause if we just say slow down, you will get nervous again and you will start to speak more quickly. But if we can reduce the amount of stress that you have, stress is really fear. it is another word for fear. So you are afraid of doing not doing so well on the test. Yeah. Even now my fingers are getting cold. So the best way to combat that is through preparation. So being totally prepared so that it is just like tying your shoelaces or driving a car or riding a bike. you have done it so many times that you, you do not get nervous riding a bike. You know, you do not get nervous tying your shoelaces. you have done it so many times that it just becomes automatic. So I would really recommend that you do a lot more practice and follow the advice that we would give you here today. And that is going to mean that you are just doing something that is routine. you are just doing something that is you are totally expecting the questions coming, you know, not the exact questions, but how you can answer any topic. So that would be one of the main things that I would suggest for you. Part two, you did really, really well. And you spoke for up to two minutes. I had to stop you, which was good. The only problem is the question asked about a famous person. So again, it is not a IQ test or a knowledge test. So you could have picked any famous business person, you know, from China, it could be Jack Ma or from America. It could be Elon Musk or so, you know, someone everybody know, or you know, a little bit about. there is no right or wrong answer. Technically the examiner does not know whether your auntie is famous or not. Because you got a lot of prizes. Yeah, but.",

      "transcript": "Or just take a few seconds to think about it and then calmly answer the question. You are extremely fluent, but you could do with slowing down a little bit. Fluency is not about speed, really. It is about can you speak without unnatural pauses and hesitations and things like that. You do not have a lot of, I do not know. you are not doing a lot of that. you are just speaking normally. you are speaking very quickly. Listen to the speed that I am speaking at. Like do not have to match me or anything like that. But I do not speak like this when I am speaking to my friends or my family. I would be speaking very quick, quickly compared to this. But because I am speaking to you and I want you to understand what I am saying, I am slowing things down. So fluency is a strength. but answering the question and a little bit of a weakness. vocabulary, you have a very wide ranging vocabulary. you are able to use very topic specific words, and deal with most topics very, very well. so I think vocabulary is probably your biggest strength. Grammar, you do have some little systematic errors like this. If I have enough saving, I would try to be a freelancer for one or two year. it is kind of not that hygiene enough. At least I know three language. it is totally different. But I think many of your grammar errors unusually could be related to pronunciation, which I think is your biggest weakness. Not criticizing you or anything like that. We all have strengths and weaknesses. it is fine. it is interesting you are from Myanmar. because you have, I do not deal with many Burmese students. I have been there and I have, I have taught there, but I, I, there is not a huge number, but it is interesting that you have a weakness that many Vietnamese students have, which is called final sounds. So the final sounds of a word, Vietnamese students, and you do this as well, they will often cut off the last sound. So for example, time becomes Thai. Think. Think. So you would not say think you would think, or thin, or thin, or thin. you are not saying the final sound often. Or sometimes you would miss S's off the ends of words. So that is important sometimes because tenses can often be indicated with the final sound. Like I start or I started. Like the final sign makes the difference in the tense or plural endings can change the grammar. So it is kind of relaxations, you know, so there is sometimes you are mixing those things up as well. So the final signs do affect your grammar score as well, but there are a lot of systematic errors, which means the same error is coming up again and again. So those would be the two areas that I would work on the most focusing on saying every, every syllable, especially the last syllable. Sound could solve a lot of problems because we are solving the pronunciation issue. we are solving the speaking too quickly issue and we are solving a lot of the grammar issues as well because often you are missing the last sign which affects grammar sometimes.",

Well, in rural areas, in urban areas. And finally, that you might talk about age. Young people and old people. it is a great way to set yourself apart and truly capture the examiner's imagination. For example, introvert people. This type of person will keen on learning from home because I think that they will not really enjoy when they meet people outside and talking like this because they will a little bit shy or something like that. They will feel a little bit shy, but good, really good. But in contrast, extrovert people, they will, they really would like to speak like this, like face to face. Like me, I want to, sit at a table with my teacher like this because I can acquire new knowledge better. Thank you. I can definitely tell you are an extrovert. And the final question for today, well done. Do people in your country prefer But to learn practical skills or academic skills. it is an interesting question. So she is buying time there. She would not lose marks for that. Oh, that is an interesting question. She is not hesitating.. She is relaxing and thinking about her ideas just like a native speaker has to.

Just be careful as well with those final s, practical skills. we have a lot of job in our country like hair, nail dressing, or something like that. And, that professions do not need really grammar. Those professions do not require that knowledge. Okay, academic knowledge. It really, much academic knowledge. And so I think that, we will prefer like practice and we will like have more experience from our practice. so that is why I think that we do not need a lot of, knowledge in the books. But we can deny that the knowledge from books is really useful. And in the future, I will keep reading books to have more skills. You see, I think she sort of struggled there with the ideas and putting them together but I like the way that she recovered. She said, I cannot deny the fact that there is something else. So I just love the way that she recovered from that situation there. Thank you, well done. And that brings us to the end of the test. Well done, congratulations. Fantastic. Now you guys, I promise you that the examiner will not clap at the end and often will not shake your hand but they will bring the test to an end. And that is it. that is it.

But if you would like to know how she could have improved some of those earlier answers, I highly recommend downloading the IELTS Speaking Test Video Companion booklet. you will find some sample answers and techniques that can help you with your speaking test preparation.

I know a lot of teachers will coach their students to say, that is an interesting question. But often, and frankly, in this case, it is not an interesting question. Instead, she could have just as easily said, no, I used to think about it, but I realized I do not have the talent. And the answer would be just as good. Now, another thing I noticed was the pronunciation of the word photography. I used to think that I want to learn more about photography. So here she got the word stress wrong. It should be photography, not photography. But I still know what she means. And that is the most important thing to remember. In IELTS speaking, you can make mistakes. And in this case, there is just one big error with word stress so far. So it is not a big deal. If it happens a lot, then there could be a bigger impact on her score. I will also point out that she is still not getting all of her past tense verbs quite right yet. I am sure she knows them, but I am not hearing the final d sound in the regular past tense verbs. let us keep watching.",

First off, I personally think that history is awesome, but I have to admit I appreciate how Vivian supports and justifies her position in this response. And I also like the expression, which I was not good at at all. Here she had great grammar. there is no issues with her irregular past tense verbs. I would say that so far she is achieving at least a score of six for grammar, but for a seven I am not totally convinced yet. It is possible. In IELTS speaking, the past simple subject verb agreement and articles are used in almost every sentence. So if you are aiming for a seven, these need to be a bit more under control.",

For instance, grandparents enjoy spending time with their grandchildren and it is handy to have grandparents looking after the small kids when the parents are out working. Since Vivian has used an if clause at the beginning of her answer, I might recommend that she use another if sentence here.

      "transcript": "Because to you, it sounds totally fine because you have been speaking, let us call it Filipino English for many, many years. And no one has ever said that is an error. But when you do the IELTS test, again, you are moving to an English speaking country. They will pick up on those errors that you are completely unaware of. So for example, staff was not that much helpful. It should have been the staff were not very helpful. Or every household in Philippines, there is really gardens. Instead of in every household in the Philippines, there are gardens. I know exactly what you are saying. Yeah. there is no problem with meaning, but there are a lot of those little, for example, subject verb agreement issues, article issues. there is some tense inconsistencies. So the way that the IELTS examiner will think about your grammar score is number of sentences with or without errors. So for example, let us say just using round numbers, let us say you spoke 100 sentences. If more than 50 of those sentences had grammatical errors in them, more than half, you would get about six for grammar. If more than 50 of those sentences had zero errors, those would be known as error-free sentences, you would get at least a band seven. In my opinion, there were more small, just small little errors in most sentences, so you would get a band six for grammar. This is extremely common for Filipino students, and this is one of the main reasons why they get 6.5. So their fluency is great. They answer the questions. Their vocabulary is quite good. Their pronunciation is excellent. But this grammar issue brings them down. That should be your main area of focus. So overall, you would be in and around 6.5 or 7 overall. Now for most people, 7 is, is, great for, from whatever they need to do. but 6.5 is often not good. depends on what you want to do. My, advice would be to really focus on grammar and that can be quite difficult because as I said before, a lot of these issues are ingrained because you have been making those errors for years and you, you do not know you have, you are even making them. It does not affect communication. So it is not a huge issue. It just depends on what score you are hoping to get.",

      "transcript": "That one was initially misunderstood. But I think very vitally in this question you understood part two. You completely misunderstood that question. So because of that, that is going to impact your grade quite a lot in this case. So, the question in part two was describe an occasion when somebody gave you positive advice or suggestions about your work or study. So, that would be a case where, let us say, you were working on a project or you were studying for an exam or taking a course. Yeah. And somebody gave you advice on how to improve, how to be better. I think your answer was not completely, ticking the boxes of what we wanted to know. For example, who the person is, what they said, how the advice affected you. So, I think you were, you talked about your friend saying that you have to be confident, which is not completely wrong, but it was maybe not specific enough. So, that is also maybe something that as you improve your vocabulary, it would be easier for you to understand these questions. So, I think if I had to give you a score, I would say about a 4.0. Oh. So, there is room for improvement, but there are positives. Even though a 4.0 is not a particularly high score, I think the fact that you are confident means that you will be able to take this feedback in a good way. Yeah. And you will be able to work in the right direction. So that next time you come and do this, you will be able to get a 5.5 or maybe a 6. Yeah, I hope. So, yeah. I think if I can give you good advice, first work on your vocabulary. Because that is going to improve your ability to express yourself. And it is also going to improve your ability to understand the questions better. Yeah. Once you have got the vocabulary, that is when you can start worrying about the grammar and the sentence structure. Because even though those things are important, if you do not know the words to use, it does not matter if you know the grammar or not. You can know the rules, but if you do not know the words to use, the grammar is useless. So I would always advise students get the vocab first and then the grammar becomes easier after. Because then you have the tools to build something with. Yeah. But otherwise keep going at it. I believe in you. Yeah, thank you. I think you will get on the road to improve very quickly. Yeah. that is cool. Best of luck to you, man. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.",

This kind of compound complex sentence would be the way to earn those high scores. Giving a simple answer as Anthony did would be a band four. Poor grammar and unfinished sentences continue to degrade Anthony's overall score for the speaking section. In order to avoid this, a couple of tricks that you can follow are to reflect the grammar of the questions. When asked how have grocery stores changed in the past few decades, you should respond by using the question and using the grammar, stating they have changed a lot in the last 10 to 20 years. Nowadays, most grocery stores offer a wide range of foods from around the world. By using the question to start your response, you are able to build momentum and fluency. But of course, this takes practice. Pay attention to building your vocabulary using connective words as often as possible and paying attention to good strategy, answering, explaining, and giving examples.

      "question": "Why do people want to learn a foreign language?",
      "transcript": "I think that depends a bit on the person, but probably the most common motivation is to be able to talk to people from other countries who have a different cultural background, who speak a different language. Because I think that being able to speak a foreign language really opens doors to you. Because even if you go to a different country, if you do not speak the language, people are less willing to share information with you. And if you do approach the people in their own language, they are usually very glad to help you out and to explain more. So what is the best way to learn a foreign language Through reading through writing or through speaking Yeah For me personally it listening and speaking and just a bit of kind of trial and error but I do think that depends a lot on the person and their personality because I think an introvert person would probably rather study at home and read and write and study maybe the grammar rather than approach a different person directly And, practice their speaking skills.",

If you are speaking with your examiner, you are just interacting with your interviewer, but he didn't interact. If you don't interact and in third part especially if you don't have strong opinions, then you can't expect good scores. So that is why I'm giving 5 for this speaking and better luck next time. If you guys are doing the same mistake then avoid doing this. Thank you so much.

      "transcript": "That is really important. try to paint a clear well ststructured not a confusing but a well ststructured picture in your listener's mind using adjectives, adverbs and different kinds of sensory language. language that talks about the senses, how something feels, how something smells, how something tastes, how something looks, and how something sounds. Of course, use compound complex language. If you want to get a score over six, you cannot just use simple sentences. You have to join the sentences with conjunctions like and, nor, but, for, so, therefore, since, when, if, however, so on. So, review your conjunctions if you are not sure. And of course, use adjective clauses. Adjective clauses are a big part of the descriptive language. Now these three elements are related to each other. So when your language is complex, it also becomes more coherent. when your language is more natural again it is more coherent. when it is more complex it is more natural. So that is why you see these circles joined because complexity, coherence and natural language they each depend on each other. So as you improve one area, you improve the other areas. So work on each area individually and then combine them. So again, as I mentioned with this candidate, coherence is quite high. She gives very complete, clear answers, does not go off topic. she uses quite a bit of complex language. go back, review the interview again, pay attention to how descriptive her language is when she talks about part two. pay attention to how well she joins her sentences in all three parts with conjunctions and use of adjective clauses. The only element that is dropping her mark from being even higher, an eight or an 8.5, is some elements of the natural language. Sometimes it is a little bit unclear, a little bit difficult to hear what she is trying to say, but otherwise overall a very good interview. Definitely a 7 to 7.5 on the IELTS. go back again, watch the interview again, watch for these elements, watch how she uses these elements effectively, and then practice that at home. Try to replicate, copy the style and these three important parts and for sure in your next IELTS exam you will also get a high score and.",

The story follows a family who moved an old fame house and begins to experience terrifying supernatural events. the warren who are god hunters. They try to remove evil spirits that haunting the house. I really love this film because it is not just about scary, but it is also very wellmade. The acting, lighting, and sound are incredible. So, it is creating a strong sense of suspense. And like I was mentioned, it is not just about scary. They not only rely on jump scares, but it is build psychological tension throughout the strong. So the film is made me feel very chills when I watch it and and I really admire how skill how skillfully it was directed. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Yeah.",

      "transcript": "Let us jump straight into part one of the speaking test. In part one, the examiner will begin by introducing themselves, then asking you to state your name and show your identification. Then, they will ask you three sets of questions about familiar topics. The first set usually asks you general questions about yourself, such as your work or study, your home, or the place where you live. The second and third sets are personal questions about familiar topics like the food you like, your hobbies, people you spend time with, and so on. you will get up to 12 questions in this part, and it is important to know how to answer them well in the time given. But do not worry, today you will only get four part one questions. Here are my tips for part one. First, give extended answers. As a general rule, I would say try to talk for around 20 seconds for each answer. that is the equivalent of about two to three written sentences. Try to add more information to your response, such as giving an example or a reason to explain your answer. Also, make sure your answers have complete sentences. do not just give single word answers. Finally, there are no right or wrong answers to the questions, but what you say should answer the question. Now, it is time for you to try part one. I am going to ask you one set of questions, and you will have 20 seconds to answer each. And to get the most out of today's practice test, I recommend you record your answers so you can go back and check how you went.",

It was a great choice because hot pot is such a social meal. You sit around a steaming pot cooking your own food and it naturally creates conversation. The atmosphere in the restaurant was warm and lively with the sound of bubbling broth and people chatting all around us. We ordered a vegetarian hot pot which was perfect because Alex is vegetarian. There was a huge variety of fresh ingredients, mushrooms, tofu, leafy greens, and noodles. I remember the spicy broth being absolutely delicious, and we kept adding more ingredients as we talked. The whole experience felt interactive, which made the meal even more enjoyable.",

There was a huge variety of fresh ingredients, mushrooms, tofu, leafy greens, and noodles. I remember the spicy broth being absolutely delicious, and we kept adding more ingredients as we talked. The whole experience felt interactive, which made the meal even more enjoyable.",

You cannot be brutally honest with someone because you might end up pushing him or her to. So in this case, you have to be really empathetic or trying to choose your words wisely. But in terms let us say someone who is actually rude or not a nice person and someone who is a bully or trying to attack someone you have to be brutally honest and strict with them and tell them you are doing something wrong.

Your answers were quite elegant because you were not trying to show off. You were not trying to give crazy big answers and you were not really nervous. You were giving very natural answers just like speaking to a friend or a colleague. and I do not want to use the word simple because the people at home watching might think that simple means basic. I do not mean simple in terms of basic. I mean simple in terms of elegant and simple in terms of effective. so very very impressive. Your development was spoton. You were not giving too much and you were not giving too little. you would answer the question and then you would give enough information for the examiner to really judge your pronunciation, your grammar, your vocabulary, your fluency and all all of that was good.

      "question": "What does that mean?",
      "transcript": "So one of the things that it means is intonation. Sometimes our voices go up sometimes our voices go down. And what we do in English is we use that to convey meaning. I do not know what it is like in is Arabic your your native language. I do not know if they use intonation to show meaning, but in a different language they do. Yeah, they do. You do not speak with what we would call a monotone, which is basically someone who just speaks with completely flat, but you are you are so cool that you are not going up or downation. So, that would be one area of improvement. it is not bad. Yeah, it is not bad. it is just a part of my character. It is. Yeah, it is. But it is important on the test day. On test day for general communication, it does not I do not think it is terribly important for you to invest a lot of time in that. But if you wanted to ban nine, you would have to work on that a little bit. The quick way of fixing that is to speak with things very passionately. You love talking about fashion. Oh, you know, my style used to be this. You will naturally improve your intonation by adding more emotion, but you seem like you are quite cool and collected, so maybe that is part of your character and that is not going to but it again, not everybody needs a band now. And it might actually lead to more issues because if you are thinking about being more emotional, it could affect your answers, it could may lead to mistakes because you are thinking in an unnatural way. So I I would not necessarily do that. Other thing is connected speech. So when we speak in English, I would not say, \"Do you want a coffee?\" Say, \"Do you want a coffee?\" Yeah. You speak more towards the end of saying each word, each syllable individually because you speak quite slowly. You do not connect the words together as much as a native English speaker would. Again, not a criticism for you in your job. I think the most important thing is that you should be understood. So again, if you try and learn lots of connected speech and you start talking like the way I am talking right now, I do not talk to my family and friends like this. I am speaking extremely slowly for me and clearly for for the people watching at home. If you heard me speaking to my friends, I would understand. You would not understand anything.

So, I am sure you know people, your friends or family that do not speak English to the level that you do and and they are searching for the correct adjective or the correct tense. you are not doing that at all. You are doing what we call searching for ideas. Again, I do not think it is a huge issue. you are quite a unique candidate in that if we tried to make you better, it might make you worse. Yeah. I do not understand that. Yeah. So if we tell you do not think and just speak the first thing that pops into your head, that would be my advice for most students. Yeah. But for you, I think that your style of communication actually is improved by thinking deeply about it. But on test day, I would not try and think of the absolute best idea. I would think of what is the easiest idea for me to talk about. And that will improve your fluency a little bit. I would say your fluency is at a band eight because of that reason that you do pause quite a lot. and if I give you a band nine, everybody in the comments will be like, he pauses too. But the the the key for people back home is that what it says in the marking criteria is unnatural pausing. I have gotten to know you today, so I know that the pausing is not unnatural. it is actually who you are. But an examiner on test day does not know you at all. and they might think, well, he he does not know the right adjective. He does not know the right tense. You know, for most people in the world, a band eight is extremely high and is good enough to move to any country in the world. Band 9 is just showing off. You know, band I am humble. I need a nine. Grammar, you have enough grammatical structures to talk about anything. So some people if you ask them to talk about the past and compare it to the future they do not know really how to do it or compare two things they do not really you have no issues whatsoever. You do make little grammatical errors sometimes. So for example this is a mistake that I actually make more simple instead of simpler or you said open for instead of open to. So like a little preposition error but native English speakers make those little slips too. I make those little slips. So what it says in the marking criteria for band nine is the mistakes that you make are slips like that and they are very infrequent. So I think your grammar is at a band nine. Same with your vocabulary. Sometimes you could use a word that is a little bit more advanced. If I give you the advice of improve the complexity, you might make more mistakes.

So I would give you a very good grade for vocabulary. your fluency was very good. &gt;&gt; Here or there you paused. &gt;&gt; However, there is a difference in how we grade pausing.

You were not like fishing for words. Yeah, we are trying to think of actually what to respond to the question.

So, yeah, overall very positive. if I had to grade you, it would definitely be in the 8 to 8.5 range. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; So, yeah, very natural sounding, very native sounding.

When taking the IELTS Speaking test via Zoom, first, we 'll be called into a small room by the coordinator, similar to when you take the IELTS FaceTime test. there is already a laptop connected to the screen. Once connected, you can sit back and relax. let us start the test! So now they will ask me if I heard clearly, and you can adjust the volume in the lower part of the microphone I am wearing. I can increase or decrease the volume if I can hear clearly or feel it is too loud. The special thing is that when speaking, during the scene I just experienced in January, I still remember wearing a mask. Everyone else was saying, \"Why, it is an online exam?\" it is true that I did not see the person watching in person, and I still wore a mask. The reason I received was that this is for safety reasons. The microphone used during the exam is shared among the candidates, so you should wear a mask to protect yourself and those around you. Before entering the exam room, the staff reminded me that if, during the exam, for any reason, I could not hear the answer clearly, or I could andt hear a word clearly, I could ask again. I see that they repeat the questions for me, and this will not completely affect my score. Yeah, I am pretty reassured about that. Next, there will always be people standing outside, and if there is any problem, I just have to knock on the door and they 'll come in to help me during the Speaking section of the exam. So, Maximark will ask me directly as usual. But others will share their screens via a mouth-reading app, and that makes it quite clear to read. that is all; everything goes very normally. My speaking will be automatically recorded on the exam board's system, so you do not have to press any buttons or anything during the exam. You just have to do what you need to do to speak. And after you have finished your practice, you just stand there and leave. I spat it out, stood up, and went outside. Then I was in charge. The coordinator reminded me to check if my exam file was okay after about 3 to 5 minutes. If it was okay, I would proceed to hand it over to her, and that was it. If you need it, you can keep it simple like that. This is the zoom screen that will appear when you enter the exam room. I am only allowed to sit here, and I will be on the screen like this. I have placed this camera somewhere, and on this side is the spinner screen. Of course, I 'll also turn on the camera. I am just giving an example. And the thing is, I just sit here and speak very normally. that is my experience when I took the IELTS Speaking online via Zune last January. I went to Ngoc Khanh beach, and I hope that through this video, you will feel a little more at ease about what to do if you register for the IELTS exam in the future. I am not a fan of IELTS, but I think the most important thing when I passed was to be confident in myself and just go into the exam room and express myself. that is all I need. I wish you all a great exam experience! Bye.",

      "transcript": "&gt;&gt; Horrible question. &gt;&gt; well, it is just opening a door in front of older people. number one, &gt;&gt; women, pregnant women or &gt;&gt; like just people in general or maybe in a crowded train also you leave a seat to a person. &gt;&gt; Give up your seat or just give your seat is probably better than leave &gt;&gt; who is older or you see that they are carrying bags. This is the act of politeness. saying thank you. It does feel like the candidate is just listing different ways and you might think well you know that is what the question demands is not it like how do people show politeness surely you just give a list of different things but it is not really the best way of developing think it is much better to just you know list one or two I think you know like in most countries people show politeness by giving up their seat on the metro especially to you know a disabled person or a pregnant woman or an old person something like this but I think The thing in my culture that really stands out is like how we have polite language. Like the type of language we use with young kids is very different to the type of language that we use with older people. And I do not know, maybe that is the same in many languages. But I do not know, in my first language, it just feels like through some of this vocab and grammar that we use, it kind of signals some high level of respect for older people. And that would be a better answer because we are not just listing. we are we are trying to give some extra details. &gt;&gt; sending flowers or thank you cards. &gt;&gt; Okay, we can stop listing now. &gt;&gt; treating people with food or just &gt;&gt; Yeah, we just have list list. I do not know inviting them for for dinner could be &gt;&gt; yeah politen I mean tricky and again this is seems to be an instant where and it is a natural reaction candidates are looking for the right answer instead of talking through. Now I think what is going on in arena's mind is I I am not really sure how we show politeness. So maybe we do this and then we do this and then we do this and then we do this and then we do this and then we do this. Whereas maybe the best approach to say maybe the best approach or a better approach would be to be honest and say how do we show politeness? I do not know if there is anything specific about like my country. Of course, we say like please and thank you and and things like this and we apologize if we do something wrong, but I do not know.",

      "question": "That grammar error becomes ingrained and then you go and do an IELTS test or you move to an English-speaking country and then you why do people think that I am making mistakes or why am I getting a lower score?",
      "transcript": "Because to you it sounds totally fine because you have been speaking let us call it Filipino English for many many years and no one has ever said that is an error but when you do the IELTS test again you are moving to an English-speaking country they will pick up on those errors that you are completely unaware of so for example staff was not that much helpful it should have been the staff were not very helpful or every household in Philippines there is really gardens Instead of in every household in the Philippines, there are gardens. I know exactly what you are saying. &gt;&gt; there is no problem with meaning, but there are a lot of those little, for example, subjectverb agreement issues, article issues. there is some tense inconsistencies. So, the way that the IELTS examiner will think about your grammar score is number of sentences with or without errors. So for let us say just using round numbers, let us say you spoke 100 sentences. If more than 50 of those sentences had grammatical errors in them, more than half, you would get a band six for grammar. If more than 50 of those sentences had zero errors, those would be known as error-free sentences. You would get at least a band seven. In my opinion, there were more small just small little errors in most sentences. So you would get a band six for grammar. This is extremely common for Filipino students and this is one of the main reasons why they get 6.5. So their fluency is great. They answer the questions. Their vocabulary is quite good. Their pronunciation is excellent but this grammar issue brings them down. That should be your main area of focus. So overall you would be in and around 6.5 or seven overall. Now, for most people, seven is is great for from whatever they need to do. but 6.5 is often not good. depends on what you want to do. My advice would be to really focus on grammar and that can be quite difficult because as I said before a lot of these issues are ingrained because you have been making those errors for years and you you do not know you you are even making them. It does not affect communication so it is not a huge issue. It it just depends on what score you are hoping to get.",

Overall, Ni did a fantastic performance and she really got into the the mood and the shape of things at the end. For me, her pronunciation overall was very good. I think that is probably her strongest of the four marking criteria. Pronunciation was the best. Next, I would like to compliment her fluency. Overall, there was a little bit of hesitation in these answers, but I do not think that it would affect her score too much because overall it was good. In terms of grammar, there were a few past tense mistakes, but overall, I would say it was pretty good as well. For me, the most important thing for N to work on is to try and maybe improve her vocabulary. There was quite a lot of simple vocabulary in her answers, although she did use some beautiful phrases as well. Help me to shape and determine my future. It depends on personality. So, there were a few good phrases in there as well, but for me, vocabulary would be the thing that I would encourage N to work on most.

Brilliant. &gt;&gt; The world is developing every day and we if we don't find out the way to improve ourself, we will cannot keep up with each other. &gt;&gt; I like how she self-corrected there. We will cannot keep up with each other. That's great. If you can do that in the exam, please do it. And imagine that everyone is moving forward quickly and we just working slowly or surfing the internet and do nothing. So I think it is vitally important to improve ourself by new knowledge &gt;&gt; by learning new knowledge just be careful there &gt;&gt; in order to survive and growth in today's world. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

So this is an interesting one. Remember in part three you do not really want to be talking about yourself too much. So try to if you can talk about wider society. So I liked it at the start she referred to people or students need to manage their time but then we went a little bit talking about herself.

The reason Khan spoke so nicely was she used a lot of the strategies and techniques that I teach my students at IELTS with Charles.

That was nice. Yes. Um I would like to to work a little bit on some pronunciation. So the final sounds like uh sometimes because you know just the little final sounds many activities. So just working on the final sound with the s also I will spend time with you to teach you some structures for part two just to organize your ideas. But again I thought you did a great answer. Yeah. And in part three again more questions about technology. Sorry about that. But I thought you you handled them well. Just be careful if they ask you what are the disadvantages of technology. You taught me the advantages. So just the disadvantages is like the negatives, the bad things. So I would say oh uh technology now is very timeconuming. Mhm. Young people have a problem when they go on Facebook and they see people that are very beautiful. It's bad for their mental health. Something like that. Just a different ideas there. Yeah. Uh I will also teach you some strategies for part three. Um one good thing that you could do uh Mr.",

Of course, use compound complex language. If you want to get a score over six, you cannot just use simple sentences. You have to join the sentences with conjunctions like and, nor, but, for, so, therefore, since, when, if, however, so on. So, review your conjunctions if you are not sure. And of course, use adjective clauses. Adjective clauses are a big part of the descriptive language. Now these three elements are related to each other. So when your language is complex, it also becomes more coherent. when your language is more natural again it is more coherent. when it is more complex it is more natural. So that is why you see these circles joined because complexity, coherence and natural language they each depend on each other. So as you improve one area, you improve the other areas. So work on each area individually and then combine them. Okay. So again, as I mentioned with this candidate, coherence is quite high. She gives very complete, clear answers, does not go off topic. she uses quite a bit of complex language. go back, review the interview again, pay attention to how descriptive her language is when she talks about part two. pay attention to how well she joins her sentences in all three parts with conjunctions and use of adjective clauses. The only element that is dropping her mark from being even higher, an eight or an 8.5, is some elements of the natural language. Sometimes it is a little bit unclear, a little bit difficult to hear what she is trying to say, but otherwise overall a very good interview. Definitely a 7 to 7.5 on the IELTS. go back again, watch the interview again, watch for these elements, watch how she uses these elements effectively, and then practice that at home. Try to replicate, copy the style and these three important parts and for sure in your next IELTS exam you will also get a high score and good luck.",

You put your arm around them when they were overcome with emotion and you you helped them to to be more fruitful. So that was really impressive. If I was to give you a little bit of advice moving forward, I would say that the two main things to focus on is or are fluency in terms of intonation. So I would have liked a little bit more of your personality like you have in class, you know, just to kind of show that personality come through.
