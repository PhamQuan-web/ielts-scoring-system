You know you should watch something that is more regarding daily lives. I I mean there is a one show called Brothers and Sisters.

L1 user is what people call native speakers now. But some people don't like the term native speaker, so they use the word L1 user. Sorry.

It's noticeable. It's really, you know, I don't like these situations. &gt;&gt; I think so. The candidate wrote wrote to me afterwards and I think this was the um instance where she said she forgot the word awkward. Um, everyone forgets words from time to time. It's absolutely fine to forget words and and sometimes it's horrible because you really that that's the one word that's the only word I want to use. of course paraphrasing around it, you know, it's uncomfortable or it feels not very good, you know, absolutely fine. Always better to find the paraphrase than to struggle with trying to find that word. But on a human level, I fully understand when you have a word on the tip of your tongue when you that word it's really um you just can't think of that word. It can be frustrating. I didn't even notice at the time just noticing it watching it back and after the candidate wrote to say that she forgot that word awkward it's now it's a bit noticeable.",

You know, a faster way to get to it might be something like, well, I I am not a very good apologizer naturally. So, I had to learn a bunch of different stuff about like emotional intelligence to become a better apologizer. And one time when I needed to apologize happened a couple of years ago when I had this huge fight with my husband because you know he had given her a bit of fish and it turned out that the cat you know did not really not that the cat did not like the fish but that the fish did not really like the cat and my cat got sick as a result of this. So of course I lost my temper and I started shouting at my husband and he started shouting back and normally he does not do that but I knew I was in the wrong so it was time to apologize. And then we can just that is like 20 seconds or 25 seconds and now boom we are there. we are at the heart. We talk about how we apologize and then we can get into the feeling.

Going too far is definitely better. not getting too far. &gt;&gt; Then I remembered some videos about emotional intelligence and I said like let us stop, breathe. I &gt;&gt; Okay, so now she is talking about how she apologized. Oh, she is talking about how she resolved the fight rather than apologizing.

The atmosphere was so lively with musicians playing everywhere. I learned a lot about Italian culture and made some great memories. One evening, we watched a sunset by the Grand Canal which was breathtaking. I think I could go back there anytime. &gt;&gt; That sounds like a wonderful experience.",

What often happens is because the examiner has to ask you so many different questions in part one, they will stop you and they will move on to the next question and you have not answered it yet. The Philippines is known for having high levels of English but often scores can be quite low. that is one of the problems and I will talk about other problems really specifically for Filipinos but you know it is related to a lot of people that is one of the issues is just not answering the question.

      "question": "That grammar error becomes ingrained and then you go and do an IELTS test or you move to an English-speaking country and then you why do people think that I am making mistakes or why am I getting a lower score?",
      "transcript": "Because to you it sounds totally fine because you have been speaking let us call it Filipino English for many many years and no one has ever said that is an error but when you do the IELTS test again you are moving to an English-speaking country they will pick up on those errors that you are completely unaware of so for example staff was not that much helpful it should have been the staff were not very helpful or every household in Philippines there is really gardens Instead of in every household in the Philippines, there are gardens. I know exactly what you are saying. &gt;&gt; there is no problem with meaning, but there are a lot of those little, for example, subjectverb agreement issues, article issues. there is some tense inconsistencies. So, the way that the IELTS examiner will think about your grammar score is number of sentences with or without errors. So for let us say just using round numbers, let us say you spoke 100 sentences. If more than 50 of those sentences had grammatical errors in them, more than half, you would get a band six for grammar. If more than 50 of those sentences had zero errors, those would be known as error-free sentences. You would get at least a band seven. In my opinion, there were more small just small little errors in most sentences. So you would get a band six for grammar. This is extremely common for Filipino students and this is one of the main reasons why they get 6.5. So their fluency is great. They answer the questions. Their vocabulary is quite good. Their pronunciation is excellent but this grammar issue brings them down. That should be your main area of focus. So overall you would be in and around 6.5 or seven overall. Now, for most people, seven is is great for from whatever they need to do. but 6.5 is often not good. depends on what you want to do. My advice would be to really focus on grammar and that can be quite difficult because as I said before a lot of these issues are ingrained because you have been making those errors for years and you you do not know you you are even making them. It does not affect communication so it is not a huge issue. It it just depends on what score you are hoping to get.",

Oh we have a lot of job in our country like hair, nail dressing or something like that and that professions do not need really &gt;&gt; grammar those professions do not require that knowledge okay academic knowledge &gt;&gt; really much academic knowledge &gt;&gt; and so I think that we will prefer like practice and we will like have more experience from our practice. is so that is why I think that we do not need a lot of knowledge in the books but we cannot deny that the knowledge from books is really useful and in the future I will keep reading books to have more skill &gt;&gt; you see I think she sort of struggled there with the ideas and and putting them together but I like the way that she she recovered she said I cannot deny the fact that something else so I just love the way that she recovered from that situation there &gt;&gt; thank you well And that brings us to the end of the test. &gt;&gt; Well done.

And that is it. that is it. Remember, around 12 to 15 minutes and it is all over. So, do not put too much pressure on yourself. You can see Khan was nervous. she told us at the start, but she did a fantastic job because she took a deep breath and tried to overcome that fear. The reason Khan spoke so nicely was she used a lot of the strategies and techniques that I teach my students at IELTS with Charles. So, if you want more information about those, please watch some of my other videos. Let me know down in the comments down below what score do you think Khan got.
