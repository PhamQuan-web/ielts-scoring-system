So I said yes even though I was not feeling like trying his food. but I saw how how he was cooking it and it felt like it looked quite good and safe and then once we sat together and started eating I realized how wrong I was because it was so mouthwatering and actually I could not expect anything like that. I do not know the name of the dish, but it was with rice and chicken meat. I guess it is kind of staple food for people who live in India. And it was not that spicy at all. as we were eating and you know sharing some good stories over a meal, I felt so good about being able to explore something new and also connect with my friend on.

But of course it was very difficult to get into this school because it was not right by our house. So it was not actually in the same borough. But anyway, I still got into this school and I was very proud to go there because I very much liked the subjects and all the facilities, particularly the drama room, the music rooms, And all the pianos, as I play piano personally. I have been playing since I was a small boy. I went to this school for about six years, if I remember correctly. And I stayed there to study at the college section. We call that sixth form. I very much liked the teachers at Southgate School and all the subjects that I took, particularly theatre studies and media studies. And I loved the facilities, but the one thing I did not like about it was the pupils, sadly enough. Because lots of them were bullies. There were about 1,500 pupils going to this huge school, if I remember correctly. And they were, lots of them were bullies. They were very rude. They could be racist at some points. But I had to deal with these problems and I had to deal with a lot of beat-ups too. I was beaten up many, many times on many, many days. In fact, there were many occasions where I have.

But anyway, I still got into this school and I was very proud to go there because I very much liked the subjects and all the facilities, particularly the drama room, the music rooms, And all the pianos, as I play piano personally. I've been playing since I was a small boy. I went to this school for about six years, if I remember correctly. And I stayed there to study at the college section. We call that sixth form. I very much liked the teachers at Southgate School and all the subjects that I took, particularly theatre studies and media studies. And I loved the facilities, but the one thing I did not like about it was the pupils, sadly enough. Because lots of them were bullies. There were about 1,500 pupils going to this huge school, if I remember correctly. And they were, lots of them were bullies. They were very rude. They could be racist at some points. But I had to deal with these problems and I had to deal with a lot of beat-ups too. I was beaten up many, many times on many, many days. In fact, there were many occasions where I've.

As you know, complex structure, complex grammatical structure is not only about long and complicated sentences which are incorrect. No, it's not. Exactly. But you should instead be able to make and use them accurately. Use them accurately. Yeah. And the best way you could do that in my opinion is just to, I wasn't rushing too much if you noticed. I was comfortable with what I was talking about, but the slower you go, not too slow, because you have to be fluid and coherent. Yeah, you're a native speaker, you can manage to speak fast, but we shouldn't, everyone should be careful. Don't rush. Yeah, don't rush, don't speak very fast, because you will lose your confidence, and it will ruin everything. You don't want to fall off the rails. Just imagine yourself when you're talking, that you're on, you're a train on these rails, you want to keep it smooth. You don't want to, you know, just waddle here and there back and forth. You just want to stay smooth. Keep the conversation going, but smooth. Yes, so just, you should, um, be careful with your structure. Try to use some conditional sentences, relative clause, compound sentences, and all these different structures. And try to speak up. If you speak loudly, you're less likely to be stressed and you'll make less pronunciation problems, so. Yes, that's right. That was just great. Thank you very much. I guess we're done here. Yes, we are. But just before we go, guys, remember,.",

Because Asia is quite, quite close and we are sharing a similar country and we are sharing a similar culture with Korea. So they want to enjoy new environment by taking a flight or by taking traveling. Okay good good And for the final question if if a person travels to a country with a very different culture what kind of problems could they encounter there are a lot of problems could be but I could say the food with some particular things like the cow or the pork someone from the American, someone from Africa, they, they believe some relief. And so they should be careful not to eat some food like cow and pork. But Korea does not have their culture, so they should be careful and Korean restaurants, give some, Korean restaurants need to give some notice for the foreign people to be careful of some food. Alright, okay, so thanks for coming in for the test. we will go to the feedback part now. So I think overall your score is probably going to be about a 5.0. Possibly, now as the speaking exam is subjective, possibly could go up a little bit. But I would say if I were to give you one score now, it would be a 5.0. A lot of good points, a lot of positives. you are very fluent in your answers. Their hesitation was very minimal. Okay, so that is a really good point with your answers. They were also very logical, very easy to understand. Okay, so communication was not really an issue when we were talking. So that is really good. Main issue I think is with grammar. There was too many errors that might just pull you down a bit. Just with, a little bit with tense and a little bit with preposition, preposition, with two and four articles with the and a. For example, in front of place names, you know, the, the soul, you know, the Korea, a little bit was coming in. So, and just a little bit with, the correct tense, you know, if you are talking in the, you know, present continuous, past continuous, there was a little bit of mix up there. So I think the grammar would need to be a little tighter, a little tighter. So I think, you know, because you are speaking quite fluently and quite fast, maybe the grammar is suffering because of that, you know. So I think sometimes students, if you need to slow it down a little, just to tighten the grammar a little bit, can be good. I think it is important to find the balance between the two of them. Yeah, between the two of them. yeah, in terms of like vocabulary was quite wide, you know, it was quite good. some like little bits were, there was a bit of confusion between a couple of words. For example, you talked about traffic in your hometown. So I think you wanted to say that transportation. Yeah, so traffic is kind of negative, but many forms of transportation is more positive.",

But I think it's important for them to learn and evaluate the current situation and see the course of history, I guess, and how things are, how things are changing and kind of adopting to that and not restricting their student, I mean, restricting their children in any way of saying you have to stay in this tiny little box, but also allow them to, um, try different things as well. And so that's a new skill, I guess, for them to learn. Okay, perfect. That will do us. Thank you very much. That's it. Alright, so.",

      "transcript": "There are a couple of reasons actually. The first reason is that sometimes native speakers do have to take the test Because maybe they studied abroad in a country where English is not the first language. And when they return to their country, maybe they are doctors or dentists, they have to take the IELTS test. So that is one reason. The second reason that we use native speakers is because we want to teach you lots of great features of language, whether that is grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation. You can learn many things and you can learn ideas from native speakers. So let, without further ado, let us have a look at Romy from Australia. let us go. Okay, I hope you are ready. I am just getting prepared and Romy is a university student and she is interested in rowing. we are going to hear about her hobbies and a little bit about her daily routine. So, we should start by pressing play. Hello and welcome to this practice exam conducted by IELTS Daily. My name is Maddy and I am your practice IELTS speaking examiner.

I see friends that I do sport with every day almost because I play sport every day. But then other people I do not see as often but I am still just as close with when I meet up with them finally. Okay, so in the speaking test you are going to be marked for pronunciation features and one of the features is that your ability to join words and phrases together and Rami does that so naturally here.

      "transcript": "Yes, I definitely think there is and this is something that I have learned about in one of the courses I am studying at uni too, which was about sports coaching. So how we can give constructive feedback and help our students to learn to learn from their mistakes. And I think it is really important when giving constructive feedback to say something positive first, to make sure you are not too negative and that you do not have a negative tone to your voice, that you are happy. and that you are just generally trying to help them. You want to give off the vibe that you are just trying to help them and not that you are trying to put them down. I think it is one of the worst things when someone's telling you something and you know they are just trying to let you down and trying to make you feel bad about yourself. So I always try and start with something positive and then say, how about we try this or how about next time you do this? I think always phrasing it as a question is also a more sensitive way to approach the topic. In pronunciation there is a feature of, of language which is called the weak form. The weak form is when we do not put the stress on the, the word. And if you go back and listen to Romy, she very often uses the weak form of the sound to, to see, to do. We do not say to see or to do, we say to see, to do. And she uses this weak form with this sound called the schwa, the a sound, the t-t-t, to see, to do, to watch, to sing.

And the problem here is that she is referring to the wrong type of noun. She is referring to a singular noun. And actually she is talking about sandals. And the correct form, the correct pronoun there should be they are easier to wear and they are, they are more comfortable. And so she is mixing up the singulars and plurals there. But then she redeemed herself and she says, because I do a lot of sport. Notice there how she is changed the because to because. Because I do a lot of sport and lots of people think that the IELTS speaking test is a formal test and that you cannot contract words, you cannot shorten words. Well that is actually a myth and the word cause is absolutely appropriate and acceptable in the test. So I encourage you, if you can use it naturally, then definitely think about that. Then she is used words like sneakers. I, I also, she said also I wear sneakers as well. She is actually repeating two cohesive devices there. She is using also and as well together.

But again, a few problems with, the wrong subject and verb. She said, the most important thing for me is comfortable. And what she is done there is she is used an adjective in the place where there should have been a noun. The most important thing for me is that they are comfortable, not it is comfortable. So, and also, that would be a complex sentence. You could replace it with a noun and you could say, The most important thing for me is comfort. And comfort is a singular word there, so you could just use the word is. You have two choices. The most important thing for me is that they are comfortable. They are comfortable. Or the most important thing for me is comfort. Two different choices. You can decide, does not make any difference. Maybe the longer one, that they are comfortable, is more complex grammatically. So maybe you want to choose that type. you, she also said but when you wear it, again it is a when sentence which is nice but she mixes up the it and they. It should be when you wear them.

And sometimes like I cannot even hear anything because there is just people around me screaming, but it really depends if the, if the concert was held in a smaller venue and there were, and it was more personal and I would prefer that. The fact that it was held in a stadium, which I have been to, it was really chaotic in the sense that I could not see anything and I could not hear anyone, anybody. Like I could not hear like the actual singer. Like I went to a Taylor Swift concert, I went to Justin Bieber and I could not even hear them like properly because there were just like people around me just screaming constantly. Fantastic. Did you notice here, and this is a really great tip for you guys, just talk as though you are talking to a friend. She spoke really naturally to the examiner and told a story about going to a concert. She explained why she did not particularly like this concert, but talked about why she would prefer another concert. Really great. But I think, yeah, again, it really depends on the personality and what interests you. Here we go again. It depends, it depends, it depends. I have probably heard that phrase now six or seven times in the past two or three minutes. I am going to give you a topic and I would like you to talk about it for one to two minutes.",

So a lot of the times, personally, I, I feel that people do cheat because, They think that they are not going to do well and that they are not going to make it. So that is why they cheat. But, that is for most, most of, most of the time. They do not rely on themselves. Thank you very much. That is the end of the speaking test. So, Alicia has done really fantastically today. I would probably give her a nine. Probably. But there are some areas where a really strict examiner would listen and maybe mark her down. Tell us what you think in the comments about this because in the pronunciation section it asks you to use a wide variety of features but you have to use them pretty accurately all the time and I wonder about the gluttal stop.

So in terms of your fluency, it was really good. There was very little hesitation throughout. You were able to speak comfortably and you answered all the questions on the spot. Really good, really good. As was your pronunciation, very clear, very accurate. There were no real issues to point out there. So yeah, fluency, pronunciation, really good, quite good, possibly like above seven. obviously there is a few vocabulary issues. let us just point out a couple just to give some examples. You were talking about your name. Yeah. and you said there were a few other candidates for your name. Like candidates suggest that, suggest to me like people, like presidential candidate would be a different person. But if you are talking about a name, I would say options. There were a few other options, but. You chose minsock. Okay, good. use the word as well disgusting for the the jeans. I probably would not use that word for jeans. Disgusting sounds just a little bit worse, a little bit extreme in that sense. for example, when you are talking about food, like really bad food, you would say disgusting or something that would make your stomach feel bad. Yeah, so yeah, maybe for that one. yeah, the word, just the word furniture is uncountable. So you would never say furnitures, just furniture. Yeah, so you can say a piece of furniture. Yeah, really good. just little, little, bit of word work between packed and crowded. they are very similar actually, you know, but if I were talking about a city, I would say crowded rather than packed. Packed suggests like you are in a room, you know, if you are talking about the subway or you are talking about a, you know, a establishment, you could say it is really packed. Because everyone's inside. Yeah. Yeah. So just a few, few little things with vocabulary there. in terms of grammar, yeah, the tense is usually all right. But I think what lets you down is just some prepositions. You know, just prepositions are kind of missing from a lot of your sentences. For example, you said go to gym, go to the gym, go to the cinema. you said Daegu is at the southern part. So you say in the southern part of Kor.",

      "question": "And what effect do you think that might have on your speech?",
      "transcript": "Well, I cannot think properly. I cannot control what I am speaking. that is what I feel when I speak, when I am nervous and I speak quickly. -huh. So we deal with a lot of students who speak too quickly. it is totally normal to speak quicker than normal when you are nervous. But let me talk about the impact that that can have on your score. So pronunciation and an examiner must understand all the words that you saying The faster you speak the more difficult it is sometimes So if you had perfect pronunciation and you spoke at that speed it wouldn be so much of a problem but because you not a native English speaker you don have perfect pronunciation with nothing wrong with that But when you combine pronunciation that needs a little bit of work with speaking really quickly it can sometimes cause a problem for the examiner to understand you So one thing that I would say straight away is try to reduce the speed at which, at which you are talking. I know that is extremely difficult for some people. It comes with practice. But if we think about the root cause of the problem, the root cause of the problem is not really the speed of your speech. there is nothing wrong with your mouth. The problem is your brain. you are nervous. so if we can attack that problem, you being nervous, that is going to reduce the speed of it. Cause if we just say slow down, you will get nervous again and you will start to speak more quickly. But if we can reduce the amount of stress that you have, stress is really fear. it is another word for fear. So you are afraid of doing not doing so well on the test. Yeah. Even now my fingers are getting cold. So the best way to combat that is through preparation. So being totally prepared so that it is just like tying your shoelaces or driving a car or riding a bike. you have done it so many times that you, you do not get nervous riding a bike. You know, you do not get nervous tying your shoelaces. you have done it so many times that it just becomes automatic. So I would really recommend that you do a lot more practice and follow the advice that we would give you here today. And that is going to mean that you are just doing something that is routine. you are just doing something that is you are totally expecting the questions coming, you know, not the exact questions, but how you can answer any topic. So that would be one of the main things that I would suggest for you. Part two, you did really, really well. And you spoke for up to two minutes. I had to stop you, which was good. The only problem is the question asked about a famous person. So again, it is not a IQ test or a knowledge test. So you could have picked any famous business person, you know, from China, it could be Jack Ma or from America. It could be Elon Musk or so, you know, someone everybody know, or you know, a little bit about. there is no right or wrong answer. Technically the examiner does not know whether your auntie is famous or not. Because you got a lot of prizes. Yeah, but.",

Well, in rural areas, in urban areas. And finally, that you might talk about age. Young people and old people. it is a great way to set yourself apart and truly capture the examiner's imagination. For example, introvert people. This type of person will keen on learning from home because I think that they will not really enjoy when they meet people outside and talking like this because they will a little bit shy or something like that. They will feel a little bit shy, but good, really good. But in contrast, extrovert people, they will, they really would like to speak like this, like face to face. Like me, I want to, sit at a table with my teacher like this because I can acquire new knowledge better. Thank you. I can definitely tell you are an extrovert. And the final question for today, well done. Do people in your country prefer But to learn practical skills or academic skills. it is an interesting question. So she is buying time there. She would not lose marks for that. Oh, that is an interesting question. She is not hesitating.. She is relaxing and thinking about her ideas just like a native speaker has to. I think Vietnamese people are keen on the practical skill because you know. Just be careful as well with those final s, practical skills. we have a lot of job in our country like hair, nail dressing, or something like that. And, that professions do not need really grammar. Those professions do not require that knowledge. Okay, academic knowledge. It really, much academic knowledge. And so I think that, we will prefer like practice and we will like have more experience from our practice. so that is why I think that we do not need a lot of, knowledge in the books. But we can deny that the knowledge from books is really useful. And in the future, I will keep reading books to have more skills. You see, I think she sort of struggled there with the ideas and putting them together but I like the way that she recovered. She said, I cannot deny the fact that there is something else. So I just love the way that she recovered from that situation there. Thank you, well done. And that brings us to the end of the test. Well done, congratulations. Fantastic. Now you guys, I promise you that the examiner will not clap at the end and often will not shake your hand but they will bring the test to an end. And that is it. that is it. Remember around 12 to 15 minutes and it is all over. So do not put too much pressure on yourself. You can see Khan was nervous.

Like me, I want to, uh, sit at a table with my teacher like this because I can acquire new knowledge better. Thank you. I can definitely tell you're an extrovert. And the final question for today, well done. Do people in your country prefer But to learn practical skills or academic skills. Ah, it's an interesting question. So she's buying time there. She would not lose marks for that. Oh, that's an interesting question. She's not hesitating. Uh, uh, uh, uh. She's relaxing and thinking about her ideas just like a native speaker has to. Um, I think Vietnamese people are keen on the practical skill because you know. Just be careful as well with those final s, practical skills. Uh, we have a lot of job in our country like hair, nail dressing, or something like that. And, uh, that professions do not need really grammar. Those professions do not require that knowledge. Okay, academic knowledge. It really, uh, much academic knowledge. And so I think that, uh, we will prefer like practice and we will like have more experience from our practice. Uh, so that's why I think that we don't need a lot of, um, knowledge in the books. But we can deny that the knowledge from books is really useful. And in the future, I will keep reading books to have more skills. You see, I think she sort of struggled there with the ideas and putting them together but I like the way that she recovered. She said, I cannot deny the fact that there's something else. So I just love the way that she recovered from that situation there. Thank you, well done. And that brings us to the end of the test. Well done, congratulations. Fantastic. Now you guys, um, I promise you that the examiner will not clap at the end and often will not shake your hand but they will bring the test to an end. And that's it. That's it. Remember around 12 to 15 minutes and it's all over. So don't put too much pressure on yourself. You can see Khan was nervous. She told us at the start but she did a fantastic job because she took a deep breath and tried to overcome that.",

In terms of grammar accuracy, there are still a few too many basic errors, which ultimately is going to make a seven difficult to reach.

For example can you construct a full sentence Can you use different tenses different grammatical structures So just listing stuff is is you limiting yourself to just a bunch of words instead of really developing it out into a full answer So for part one I would say listen to the question really focus on that And I would use the strategy of think directly answer the question right away and then develop it I not saying this for every student that is Asian but a lot of people from that part of the world have been taught to not give direct answers and not be very direct Yes. And to kind of beat around the bush, you know, not really. that is so true. that is not a criticism. that is not saying that is bad. But it is just part of your culture, especially with teachers and education to not say, this is exactly how I feel about that. That can cause problems on test day because you would say, well, there is this thing that is kind of associated with the answer and this thing that is kind of related to the answer and you never really answer the question.

Part two, similar. like part one, your fluency is great, but the thing you need to remember about fluency is fluency is connected to something called coherence.

      "transcript": "Because to you, it sounds totally fine because you have been speaking, let us call it Filipino English for many, many years. And no one has ever said that is an error. But when you do the IELTS test, again, you are moving to an English speaking country. They will pick up on those errors that you are completely unaware of. So for example, staff was not that much helpful. It should have been the staff were not very helpful. Or every household in Philippines, there is really gardens. Instead of in every household in the Philippines, there are gardens. I know exactly what you are saying. Yeah. there is no problem with meaning, but there are a lot of those little, for example, subject verb agreement issues, article issues. there is some tense inconsistencies. So the way that the IELTS examiner will think about your grammar score is number of sentences with or without errors. So for example, let us say just using round numbers, let us say you spoke 100 sentences. If more than 50 of those sentences had grammatical errors in them, more than half, you would get about six for grammar. If more than 50 of those sentences had zero errors, those would be known as error-free sentences, you would get at least a band seven. In my opinion, there were more small, just small little errors in most sentences, so you would get a band six for grammar. This is extremely common for Filipino students, and this is one of the main reasons why they get 6.5. So their fluency is great. They answer the questions. Their vocabulary is quite good. Their pronunciation is excellent. But this grammar issue brings them down. That should be your main area of focus. So overall, you would be in and around 6.5 or 7 overall. Now for most people, 7 is, is, great for, from whatever they need to do. but 6.5 is often not good. depends on what you want to do. My, advice would be to really focus on grammar and that can be quite difficult because as I said before, a lot of these issues are ingrained because you have been making those errors for years and you, you do not know you have, you are even making them. It does not affect communication. So it is not a huge issue. It just depends on what score you are hoping to get.",

So, that would be a case where, let us say, you were working on a project or you were studying for an exam or taking a course. Yeah. And somebody gave you advice on how to improve, how to be better. I think your answer was not completely, ticking the boxes of what we wanted to know. For example, who the person is, what they said, how the advice affected you. So, I think you were, you talked about your friend saying that you have to be confident, which is not completely wrong, but it was maybe not specific enough. So, that is also maybe something that as you improve your vocabulary, it would be easier for you to understand these questions. So, I think if I had to give you a score, I would say about a 4.0. Oh. So, there is room for improvement, but there are positives. Even though a 4.0 is not a particularly high score, I think the fact that you are confident means that you will be able to take this feedback in a good way. Yeah.

The other one is to fake your answer because you you might have already talked about that that topic or that kind of question. For example, I ask you about a balanced diet. You can simply say well I would say a balanced diet would be one part of the story but it is also important to have for example to get regular exercise every day because you know you can include this this and this in your diet but if you are not exercising all the time then you will not lose weight or you you will not manage to keep fit and so on.

      "transcript": "That is really important. try to paint a clear well ststructured not a confusing but a well ststructured picture in your listener's mind using adjectives, adverbs and different kinds of sensory language. language that talks about the senses, how something feels, how something smells, how something tastes, how something looks, and how something sounds. Of course, use compound complex language. If you want to get a score over six, you cannot just use simple sentences. You have to join the sentences with conjunctions like and, nor, but, for, so, therefore, since, when, if, however, so on. So, review your conjunctions if you are not sure. And of course, use adjective clauses. Adjective clauses are a big part of the descriptive language. Now these three elements are related to each other. So when your language is complex, it also becomes more coherent. when your language is more natural again it is more coherent. when it is more complex it is more natural. So that is why you see these circles joined because complexity, coherence and natural language they each depend on each other. So as you improve one area, you improve the other areas. So work on each area individually and then combine them. So again, as I mentioned with this candidate, coherence is quite high. She gives very complete, clear answers, does not go off topic. she uses quite a bit of complex language. go back, review the interview again, pay attention to how descriptive her language is when she talks about part two. pay attention to how well she joins her sentences in all three parts with conjunctions and use of adjective clauses. The only element that is dropping her mark from being even higher, an eight or an 8.5, is some elements of the natural language. Sometimes it is a little bit unclear, a little bit difficult to hear what she is trying to say, but otherwise overall a very good interview. Definitely a 7 to 7.5 on the IELTS. go back again, watch the interview again, watch for these elements, watch how she uses these elements effectively, and then practice that at home. Try to replicate, copy the style and these three important parts and for sure in your next IELTS exam you will also get a high score and.",

      "question": "Are you ready?",
      "transcript": "Let us jump straight into part one of the speaking test. In part one, the examiner will begin by introducing themselves, then asking you to state your name and show your identification. Then, they will ask you three sets of questions about familiar topics. The first set usually asks you general questions about yourself, such as your work or study, your home, or the place where you live. The second and third sets are personal questions about familiar topics like the food you like, your hobbies, people you spend time with, and so on. you will get up to 12 questions in this part, and it is important to know how to answer them well in the time given. But do not worry, today you will only get four part one questions. Here are my tips for part one. First, give extended answers. As a general rule, I would say try to talk for around 20 seconds for each answer. that is the equivalent of about two to three written sentences. Try to add more information to your response, such as giving an example or a reason to explain your answer. Also, make sure your answers have complete sentences. do not just give single word answers. Finally, there are no right or wrong answers to the questions, but what you say should answer the question. Now, it is time for you to try part one. I am going to ask you one set of questions, and you will have 20 seconds to answer each. And to get the most out of today's practice test, I recommend you record your answers so you can go back and check how you went.",

But yeah, otherwise I would say if that's your normal way of speaking, don't stress too much. &gt;&gt; Just try and think about it that way. &gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.

I do not know what it is like in is Arabic your your native language. I do not know if they use intonation to show meaning, but in a different language they do. Yeah, they do. You do not speak with what we would call a monotone, which is basically someone who just speaks with completely flat, but you are you are so cool that you are not going up or downation. So, that would be one area of improvement. it is not bad. Yeah, it is not bad. it is just a part of my character. It is. Yeah, it is. But it is important on the test day. On test day for general communication, it does not I do not think it is terribly important for you to invest a lot of time in that. But if you wanted to ban nine, you would have to work on that a little bit. The quick way of fixing that is to speak with things very passionately. You love talking about fashion. Oh, you know, my style used to be this. You will naturally improve your intonation by adding more emotion, but you seem like you are quite cool and collected, so maybe that is part of your character and that is not going to but it again, not everybody needs a band now. And it might actually lead to more issues because if you are thinking about being more emotional, it could affect your answers, it could may lead to mistakes because you are thinking in an unnatural way. So I I would not necessarily do that. Other thing is connected speech. So when we speak in English, I would not say, \"Do you want a coffee?\" Say, \"Do you want a coffee?\" Yeah. You speak more towards the end of saying each word, each syllable individually because you speak quite slowly. You do not connect the words together as much as a native English speaker would. Again, not a criticism for you in your job. I think the most important thing is that you should be understood. So again, if you try and learn lots of connected speech and you start talking like the way I am talking right now, I do not talk to my family and friends like this. I am speaking extremely slowly for me and clearly for for the people watching at home. If you heard me speaking to my friends, I would understand. You would not understand anything. So I think and connected speech is also something that is it could take years to learn.",

So while driving, she was giving me directions. But at one point, I did not feel like it was enough. So I kind of took the phone from her and in I in my way took it on my hand and was turning the map around east and west, swiping up and down trying to understand where it was. And that is when she jokingly said to me like you always spin the map around and look like in olden times when people had maps in their hand they used to hold it northwest and spin it around and look and I started laughing as well because it is kind of true and that moment that joke kind of made me realize it is very true how technology has changed my life. If I did not have Google maps with me I would be re actually holding a real life map in front of me and I would be actually spinning it around as I was driving. I do not have to do that now. I drive and the map kind of sometimes even tells me 400 meters to the right, turn left, go to this intersection, keep on straight. I do not have to look at the map all the time. It tells me and I like I can spin it much easier as well. it is not a huge piece of paper I have to spin. it is just a small screen that I can turn around with my fingers. &gt;&gt; Thank you very much.",

      "transcript": "Let us watch together! When taking the IELTS Speaking test via Zoom, first, we 'll be called into a small room by the coordinator, similar to when you take the IELTS FaceTime test. there is already a laptop connected to the screen. Once connected, you can sit back and relax. let us start the test! So now they will ask me if I heard clearly, and you can adjust the volume in the lower part of the microphone I am wearing. I can increase or decrease the volume if I can hear clearly or feel it is too loud. The special thing is that when speaking, during the scene I just experienced in January, I still remember wearing a mask. Everyone else was saying, \"Why, it is an online exam?\" it is true that I did not see the person watching in person, and I still wore a mask. The reason I received was that this is for safety reasons. The microphone used during the exam is shared among the candidates, so you should wear a mask to protect yourself and those around you. Before entering the exam room, the staff reminded me that if, during the exam, for any reason, I could not hear the answer clearly, or I could andt hear a word clearly, I could ask again. I see that they repeat the questions for me, and this will not completely affect my score. Yeah, I am pretty reassured about that. Next, there will always be people standing outside, and if there is any problem, I just have to knock on the door and they 'll come in to help me during the Speaking section of the exam. So, Maximark will ask me directly as usual. But others will share their screens via a mouth-reading app, and that makes it quite clear to read. that is all; everything goes very normally. My speaking will be automatically recorded on the exam board's system, so you do not have to press any buttons or anything during the exam. You just have to do what you need to do to speak. And after you have finished your practice, you just stand there and leave. I spat it out, stood up, and went outside. Then I was in charge. The coordinator reminded me to check if my exam file was okay after about 3 to 5 minutes. If it was okay, I would proceed to hand it over to her, and that was it. If you need it, you can keep it simple like that. This is the zoom screen that will appear when you enter the exam room. I am only allowed to sit here, and I will be on the screen like this. I have placed this camera somewhere, and on this side is the spinner screen. Of course, I 'll also turn on the camera. I am just giving an example. And the thing is, I just sit here and speak very normally. that is my experience when I took the IELTS Speaking online via Zune last January. I went to Ngoc Khanh beach, and I hope that through this video, you will feel a little more at ease about what to do if you register for the IELTS exam in the future. I am not a fan of IELTS, but I think the most important thing when I passed was to be confident in myself and just go into the exam room and express myself. that is all I need. I wish you all a great exam experience! Bye.",

You know, a faster way to get to it might be something like, well, I I am not a very good apologizer naturally.

So I was like sure I would give you like few options and the first option was Ford since I own a Ford car and it was a pickup truck. So I would definitely like recommend it for him this option but he told me like I prefer something a little bit smaller and more eco fuel and efficient. I said sure and I gave them a different options about let us say Toyota is a really good option and Nissan they have a variety of options. I really decided to help him since I have the knowledge about the cars and what is good, what is bad, what is like what fits his personality because it is really important to have a car that fits your personality other than the eco fuel system or the fancy look or the color. And I really felt happy helping him about the option and he eventually ended up buying a Ford truck. the reason why he bought this pickup truck because it is a big car and when you drive a big car in the streets, it really helps you and let us say seeing the view from afar to avoid a car accident or a sudden break and at the same time people just avoid come across coming across you and it is just like you feel like a king driving a big car.

      "question": "That grammar error becomes ingrained and then you go and do an IELTS test or you move to an English-speaking country and then you why do people think that I am making mistakes or why am I getting a lower score?",
      "transcript": "Because to you it sounds totally fine because you have been speaking let us call it Filipino English for many many years and no one has ever said that is an error but when you do the IELTS test again you are moving to an English-speaking country they will pick up on those errors that you are completely unaware of so for example staff was not that much helpful it should have been the staff were not very helpful or every household in Philippines there is really gardens Instead of in every household in the Philippines, there are gardens. I know exactly what you are saying. &gt;&gt; there is no problem with meaning, but there are a lot of those little, for example, subjectverb agreement issues, article issues. there is some tense inconsistencies. So, the way that the IELTS examiner will think about your grammar score is number of sentences with or without errors. So for let us say just using round numbers, let us say you spoke 100 sentences. If more than 50 of those sentences had grammatical errors in them, more than half, you would get a band six for grammar. If more than 50 of those sentences had zero errors, those would be known as error-free sentences. You would get at least a band seven. In my opinion, there were more small just small little errors in most sentences. So you would get a band six for grammar. This is extremely common for Filipino students and this is one of the main reasons why they get 6.5. So their fluency is great. They answer the questions. Their vocabulary is quite good. Their pronunciation is excellent but this grammar issue brings them down. That should be your main area of focus. So overall you would be in and around 6.5 or seven overall. Now, for most people, seven is is great for from whatever they need to do. but 6.5 is often not good. depends on what you want to do. My advice would be to really focus on grammar and that can be quite difficult because as I said before a lot of these issues are ingrained because you have been making those errors for years and you you do not know you you are even making them. It does not affect communication so it is not a huge issue. It it just depends on what score you are hoping to get.",

Overall, Ni did a fantastic performance and she really got into the the mood and the shape of things at the end. For me, her pronunciation overall was very good. I think that is probably her strongest of the four marking criteria. Pronunciation was the best. Next, I would like to compliment her fluency. Overall, there was a little bit of hesitation in these answers, but I do not think that it would affect her score too much because overall it was good. In terms of grammar, there were a few past tense mistakes, but overall, I would say it was pretty good as well. For me, the most important thing for N to work on is to try and maybe improve her vocabulary. There was quite a lot of simple vocabulary in her answers, although she did use some beautiful phrases as well. Help me to shape and determine my future. It depends on personality. So, there were a few good phrases in there as well, but for me, vocabulary would be the thing that I would encourage N to work on most.

      "transcript": "That is really important. try to paint a clear well ststructured not a confusing but a well ststructured picture in your listener's mind using adjectives, adverbs and different kinds of sensory language. language that talks about the senses, how something feels, how something smells, how something tastes, how something looks, and how something sounds. Of course, use compound complex language. If you want to get a score over six, you cannot just use simple sentences. You have to join the sentences with conjunctions like and, nor, but, for, so, therefore, since, when, if, however, so on. So, review your conjunctions if you are not sure. And of course, use adjective clauses. Adjective clauses are a big part of the descriptive language. Now these three elements are related to each other. So when your language is complex, it also becomes more coherent. when your language is more natural again it is more coherent. when it is more complex it is more natural. So that is why you see these circles joined because complexity, coherence and natural language they each depend on each other. So as you improve one area, you improve the other areas. So work on each area individually and then combine them. Okay. So again, as I mentioned with this candidate, coherence is quite high. She gives very complete, clear answers, does not go off topic. she uses quite a bit of complex language. go back, review the interview again, pay attention to how descriptive her language is when she talks about part two. pay attention to how well she joins her sentences in all three parts with conjunctions and use of adjective clauses. The only element that is dropping her mark from being even higher, an eight or an 8.5, is some elements of the natural language. Sometimes it is a little bit unclear, a little bit difficult to hear what she is trying to say, but otherwise overall a very good interview. Definitely a 7 to 7.5 on the IELTS. go back again, watch the interview again, watch for these elements, watch how she uses these elements effectively, and then practice that at home. Try to replicate, copy the style and these three important parts and for sure in your next IELTS exam you will also get a high score and good luck.",

I gave him those advices because I felt that he is currently being so misguided and under so much pressure that I felt the need to give him my the advices that I I that I took from my own experiences and I felt really really h I felt over the moon and a sense of relief after giving him the advice because I know that I have helped a fellow student escaped from an anxiety.

I was really listening quite intently and even with the difficult topics in part three. I mean advice is quite a difficult topic but I love that you used a variety of techniques some people but other people it depends on age or it depends on culture. I really liked how you did that. One more thing as well when you were in the part two I loved how you you kind of showed emotion about when you talked about your friend. You put your arm around them when they were overcome with emotion and you you helped them to to be more fruitful. So that was really impressive. If I was to give you a little bit of advice moving forward, I would say that the two main things to focus on is or are fluency in terms of intonation. So I would have liked a little bit more of your personality like you have in class, you know, just to kind of show that personality come through.
